/**
 * CSP for a custom collection view (see plans/feat-collections-custom-views.md).
 * Same policy as the preview header EXCEPT `connect-src` is the server origin
 * (not `'none'`): a custom view legitimately `fetch()`es its collection's data
 * endpoint.
 *
 * Threat model — a custom view is handed a scoped token (`window.__MC_VIEW`) +
 * the collection's records, so we must prevent exfiltration to an attacker:
 *   - **`connect-src` = the server origin only.** This is the channel that
 *     matters: fetch / XHR / WebSocket / sendBeacon / EventSource to an
 *     arbitrary host is what lets a malicious view stream the token/data out.
 *     Locked to the origin, the view can reach ONLY its own data endpoint.
 *   - **Resource loads (`script`/`style`/`font`/`img`) reuse the curated CDN
 *     allowlist.** A `<… src="https://cdn/x?token">` request does reach that
 *     host, but the allowlist is reputable infrastructure (jsdelivr / unpkg /
 *     cdnjs / Google Fonts / plotly) that does NOT expose per-request logs to
 *     third parties, so the token lands in the CDN's logs, never an attacker's.
 *     The allowlist-exfil bypass needs an attacker-CONTROLLABLE allowed host
 *     (open redirect, logging endpoint, attacker subdomain); none here qualify.
 *     This also lets views use charting libs (Chart.js, Plotly, D3) from a CDN.
 *
 * `origin` MUST be the explicit server origin: the sandboxed iframe has an
 * opaque origin, so `'self'` would never match (same reason the preview policy
 * substitutes the origin into `img-src`).
