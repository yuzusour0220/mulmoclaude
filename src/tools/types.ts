 * MulmoClaude ToolPlugin — no app-specific server response type needed.

 * IMPORTANT — `execute()` is NEVER called at runtime in MulmoClaude.
 * The frontend registry (see `PluginEntry` below and `src/tools/index.ts`)
 * only consumes `toolDefinition` / `viewComponent` / `previewComponent`.
 * Tool calls flow Claude → MCP (`server/agent/mcp-server.ts`) → the REST
 * endpoint listed in `server/agent/plugin-names.ts:TOOL_ENDPOINTS`,
 * bypassing every `execute()` defined in `src/plugins/<name>/index.ts`.
 *
 * Consequences:
 * - Per-mode dispatch (e.g. branch on which arg is set), arg
 *   normalization, fan-out side effects, and post-success triggers
 *   MUST live in the server route, not in `execute()`. Putting them in
 *   `execute()` looks like it works in dev but silently no-ops in
 *   production because the agent path never reaches the function.
 * - The `execute()` body is kept only to satisfy the gui-chat-protocol
 *   `ToolPlugin` shape (other host apps invoke it). Keeping it as a
 *   one-line `apiPost` pass-through is the convention — no logic there.
