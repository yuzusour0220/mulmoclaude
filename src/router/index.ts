// Vue-router setup (history mode — clean URLs without #).
//
// Each page has its own route: /chat, /files, /automations, /wiki,
// /feeds, /collections. (Skills and Roles are not pages — they live in
// the Settings modal; /skills and /roles redirect to /chat.) Layout
// preference
// (single vs. stack) is a separate concern persisted in localStorage
// — it is not part of the URL. Several pages accept an optional
// identifier (automations :taskId, feeds/collections :slug) so
// notifications and external links can deep-link to a specific item.
//
// History mode requires the server to serve index.html for any path
// that doesn't match an API route or static file. In production the
// Express catch-all `app.get("*", ...)` in server/index.ts already
// does this. In dev, Vite's default SPA fallback handles it.
