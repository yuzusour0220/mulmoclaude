// Whitelist of folders where the File Explorer offers a "New file"
// right-click action (#1598). Each entry pins the extension that the
// new file MUST receive — the UI accepts only the slug portion, so a
// user typing `my-page.txt` in a `data/wiki/pages/` row still writes
// `my-page.md`. Folders not listed here render no context menu.
//
// **Why a fixed extension per folder**: every whitelisted folder has a
// downstream consumer that depends on the extension (the wiki snapshot
// hook fires on `.md` writes under `data/wiki/pages/`, the HTML
// preview matches on `.html`, etc.). Letting the user pick an arbitrary
// extension would write a file that no part of the host knows how to
// render.
//
// **Adding a folder**: append an entry below + add an i18n key under
// `fileTree.newFilePlaceholder.*` (all 8 locales). The folder path is
// a workspace-relative POSIX string matching `TreeNode.path` for the
// folder row that should expose the menu.
