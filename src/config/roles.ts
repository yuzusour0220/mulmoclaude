// `server/agent/activeTools.ts` is the choke point that intersects
// it with the actually-loaded tool registry, so unknown names are a
// silent no-op rather than a parse failure. Two reasons we keep
// the lenient runtime parse:
//
//   - User-installed runtime plugins (`~/mulmoclaude/plugins/*`)
//     publish their `toolName` only at process start; the role file
//     lists those names but they aren't in `TOOL_NAMES` (which is
//     compile-time and host-owned). Stripping them at parse would
//     unconditionally break user-added plugins.
//   - A persisted custom role may reference a tool that was removed
//     in a later release (e.g. `manageRoles` post-#949 / #951);
//     keeping the entry preserves the user's intent visually in
//     `/roles` rather than making it disappear.
//
// Frontend create/update goes through a plugin-picker UI that only
// emits names that are loaded right now, so the lenient parse
// doesn't weaken create-time validation.

Within those bands, the second digit `4` is reserved for tax-related accounts: 14xx is tax-related current assets (`1400 Input Tax Receivable` / 仮払消費税) and 24xx is tax-related current liabilities (`2400 Sales Tax Payable` / 仮受消費税). Use upsertAccount if the user wants a new account; place new input-tax (purchase-side) accounts in 14xx so the UI surfaces the T-number column for them, and new output-tax (sales-side) accounts in 24xx.\n\n' +

Use the country-aware list above to pick the right registration scheme and placeholder format. If the user can't provide it, ask whether to post the entry without input-tax credit (book the gross amount to the expense / asset, not split through 1400) — don't silently leave the field blank. Output-tax lines (24xx, e.g. `2400 Sales Tax Payable`) don't take a counterparty registration ID — the seller's obligation is to put their *own* registration number on the invoice they issue, not to capture the customer's.\n\n" +
