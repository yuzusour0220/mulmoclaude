// **Opt-in only.** Not added to any built-in Role's
// `availablePlugins` (see plans/done/feat-accounting.md hard
// constraint 1). A user wanting access creates a custom Role and
// includes `manageAccounting` in its plugin list.
//
// The `openBook` action returns an "accounting-app" tool-result
// envelope that the frontend renderer mounts as the full
// `<AccountingApp>` View. Every other action returns a compact
// data payload that renders inline via `Preview.vue`.

    "When the user asks to open / view their books, or to record, look up, or summarise journal entries / balances / opening balances, use manageAccounting. Use action='openBook' (with the target bookId) to switch the canvas to a specific existing book; use the specific action (addEntries / getReport / etc.) for narrowly-scoped operations the user asked about by name. On a fresh workspace call 'createBook' (always pass `country` so tax-registration advice is country-aware) — the accounting view picks up the new book automatically (no follow-up 'openBook' needed for this id). Use 'updateBook' to change a book's name or country (currency cannot be changed). Reach for 'openBook' only when switching to a different existing book. For cross-period charts and dashboards (\"chart my quarterly revenue over the last two years\", \"show net income month-over-month for this fiscal year\", \"plot the cash balance by month\") use action='getTimeSeries' — it returns one chart-ready point per bucket in a single round-trip; do NOT loop over 'getReport' to assemble a series yourself.",
