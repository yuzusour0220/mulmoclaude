// The form's schema, validation, View, and Preview come from the shared
// @mulmoclaude/form-plugin package. We re-wrap its components in MulmoClaude's scoped
// runtime provider (wrapWithScope) so the package's useRuntime()/locale resolves
// to the host — which is what drives the package's bundled i18n.
//
// Coerce the package's plugin to the host's ToolPlugin type. The package is built
// with its own `vue` dep, so under yarn 4 it resolves a second @vue/runtime-core
// whose `Component` type is nominally distinct from the host's (identical at
// runtime — the built app bundles a single Vue). Without this bridge, passing the
// package's Component into the host-typed wrapWithScope makes tsc compare two giant
// equivalent Component types and blow the stack (TS2321).
