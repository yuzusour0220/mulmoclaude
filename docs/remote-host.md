# Remote Host — driving MulmoClaude from your phone

**Remote host** lets a phone browser invoke capabilities on your own MulmoClaude
server — list collections, render mobile custom views, edit records, start a
chat with image attachments — **without** exposing the server to the internet,
running Cloud Functions, or polling. The transport is a **Firestore-backed
request/response channel** in a shared public Firebase project; the phone writes
a command document, the server claims it, runs a handler, and writes the result
back over a real-time listener.

The mobile client itself (`https://mulmoserver.web.app`) lives in the sibling
repo `../mulmoserver` and is **not** part of this repo. This repo ships the
**host** half — the Firestore command loop, the handler table, and the toolbar
Connect/Disconnect control — plus the shared contract that both sides compile
against (`@mulmoclaude/core/remote-view`).

Both sides agree on a hardcoded **`hostId = "mulmoclaude"`** — there is no host
discovery or registry. Isolation is by subcollection: a user running several
hosts under the same account (laptop + this MulmoClaude) never compete for each
other's commands.

## Auth model — "Option B: the server signs in as the user"

The server authenticates to Firestore **as the user**, using the Firebase JS SDK
(no Admin SDK, no project service account distributed to self-hosted installs):

1. In the browser, `RemoteHostControl.vue` does `signInWithPopup(GoogleAuthProvider)`
   and extracts the short-lived **Google OAuth ID token**
   (`GoogleAuthProvider.credentialFromResult(result).idToken`).
2. It POSTs that token to the **loopback** route `POST /api/remote-host/connect`.
3. The server calls `signInWithCredential(auth, GoogleAuthProvider.credential(idToken))`
   → gets `auth.currentUser.uid`, then starts the host runner. The JS SDK holds
   its own refresh token for the process lifetime; the ID token is used once.

Security rules keep the server scoped to the user's own subtree:

```
match /users/{uid}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
}
```

The server holds **no project-wide privilege** — blast radius is the user's own
`users/{uid}/…` Firestore subtree. The ID token is treated as a secret: POSTed
over localhost only, never logged, not persisted to disk. The session is
**in-memory** — a server restart drops it and needs a re-connect.

> **Firestore must be in Native mode** — Datastore mode silently no-ops the web SDK.

## Where the code lives — shared transport in core, host specifics local

The generic transport is **extracted into `@mulmoclaude/core`** so both hosts
(MulmoClaude, MulmoTerminal) share one copy instead of each porting it from
`../mulmoserver` (which is where it originated). Two subpaths, split on the
browser-safe boundary — mirroring `@mulmoclaude/core/remote-view`:

| Import | Surface | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `@mulmoclaude/core/remote-host` | **browser-safe** | Protocol wire types (`Command`, `CommandStatus`, `Channel`, `CommandHandlers`) + Firestore path helpers `commandsCollection(firestore, channel)` / `hostDoc(firestore, channel)` + the capability advertisement (`HostPresence`, `REMOTE_HOST_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `buildHostPresence`). Shared by host **and** the mobile client. |
| `@mulmoclaude/core/remote-host/server` | **server-only** | `startHostRunner(firestore, channel, handlers, opts)` — the command loop; `createRemoteHost(deps)` — the connect/disconnect/status lifecycle factory; `createRemoteHostAuth(auth)` + `createRemoteHostFirebase(config)` — the Firebase init/auth primitives. `firebase` is an optional peer dep of core. |

Each host supplies only its own specifics under `server/remoteHost/`:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | Binds this host's `hostId="mulmoclaude"`, handler table, firestore-bound runner, and logger to core's `createRemoteHost`; exposes the default singleton the route uses. |
| `firebase.ts` | `createRemoteHostFirebase(firebaseConfig)` → this host's `{ firestore, auth, storage }` (Firestore must be in Native mode). |
| `auth.ts` | `createRemoteHostAuth(auth)` → `signInHost` / `signOutHost` / `currentUid` bound to this host's Firebase auth. |
| `commandChannel.ts` | Re-exports the core protocol + pins `HOST_ID = "mulmoclaude"`. |
| `handlers/index.ts` | The method table — the single place the runner learns which methods it serves. |

### The command loop, precisely (core `startHostRunner`)

- **Presence + capabilities.** `writePresence(true)` on start, then a heartbeat
  `setInterval` once a minute (`opts.heartbeatMs`, default 60 s). On `stop()` or fatal listener death it
  writes `writePresence(false)` and clears the interval — so remotes see the host go
  offline instead of a live-but-dead host that silently consumes no commands.
  Every write carries the capability advertisement (next section), not just the
  `online` flag.

### Capability advertisement — presence doc, auto-derived

The remote has no host registry and no way to know *which* methods a given host
build serves — a self-hosted install may be older, or ship a plugin that adds or
drops a capability. Rather than let the remote discover this by firing a command
and getting `unknown_method` back, the host **advertises its capabilities in the
presence doc** the remote already listens to:

```jsonc
// users/{uid}/hosts/mulmoclaude
{ "online": true, "hostId": "mulmoclaude", "protocolVersion": 2,
  "capabilities": ["listCollections", "getCollection", "startChat", …],
  "updatedAt": <serverTimestamp> }
```

- **Push, not pull.** It rides the same `onSnapshot` the remote runs for
  online/offline, so the remote knows the capability set the instant the host is
  online — no extra round trip, and it can gate UI (hide "send photo" when
  `startChat` is absent) *before* issuing anything.
- **Auto-derived, single source of truth.** `buildHostPresence` sets
  `capabilities = Object.keys(handlers)` from the live handler table, so
  registering a handler in `handlers/index.ts` is the **only** step needed to
  advertise it — there is no second list to keep in sync (the same
  "derive, don't duplicate" discipline as the handler table itself).
- **`protocolVersion`** (`REMOTE_HOST_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, currently `2`) lets the
  remote gate on wire-protocol compatibility independent of the method list; bump
  it when the command channel changes shape in a way the remote must react to.
  **v2** signals offline-queue support (the host honours `expiresAt` — deletes an
  expired command + its staged uploads instead of spawning a stale chat); a remote
  MUST see `protocolVersion >= 2` before queueing a `startChat` while offline (see
  "Offline queueing").
- The payload shape (`HostPresence`) is a **browser-safe** export both repos
  compile against, so host and mobile client can't drift on the contract.
- **Claim exactly once.** `claimCommand` runs a `runTransaction` that reads the
  doc and only flips `queued → processing` if it is still `queued`; a second
  host (or a snapshot replay) that races gets `null` and skips it.
- **Run + write back.** `runHandler` calls `handlers[method](params)` and writes
  `status:"done"` + `result`, or `status:"error"` + a `{code,message}`. Unknown
  methods write an `unknown_method` error. Write-after-delete is swallowed
  (the remote may have deleted the doc on its own timeout).

### Handler table (capabilities)

Each handler runs **in-process**, bypassing the HTTP bearer/view-token layer and
calling the collection engine directly. Added incrementally across phases:

| Method | What it returns | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `listCollections` | Collections (feeds excluded), same shape as `GET /api/collections` | 1 |
| `getCollection` | One collection's detail + a page of records | 2 |
| `listShortcuts` | Pinned launcher favorites (read-only) | — |
| `listSkills` | Skill ids as `string[]` | — |
| `listFeeds` / `getFeed` | Feed registry / one feed's detail page (read-only) | — |
| `listAccountingBooks` | `{ books: [{id,name}] }` for a mobile book picker | — |
| `getRemoteView` | A `target:"mobile"` custom view built into a sandboxed `srcdoc` | 3 |
| `getRemoteViewItems` | One page of a view's records, image fields inlined as `data:` thumbnails | 5 |
| `mutateRemoteViewItem` | Applies an update/delete from a mobile view; policy enforced **host-side** | 4 |
| `startChat` | Starts a visible chat from the phone (message + optional role + attachments) | — |
| `ingestAttachments` | Pulls staged files from Firebase Storage into the workspace | — |

---

## Custom mobile views — the postMessage bridge (phase 3+)

A phone can't reach the host's `localhost`, and handing the sandboxed iframe
Firestore credentials would defeat the sandbox. So mobile custom views replace
the desktop pattern (fetch `/view-data` with a scoped token) with an **async
postMessage bridge**: the parent page owns the data channel, and the injected
bootstrap exposes a small API the LLM-authored view just awaits.

- The whole contract is a **browser-safe** subpath: `@mulmoclaude/core/remote-view`
  — CSP builder, srcdoc wrapping + bootstrap injection, pagination clamps + field
  projection, and the parent-side message handler. It is the **single source of
  truth** for both the desktop preview and the mulmoserver client, so parity is
  structural rather than disciplined.
- The **host** wraps the srcdoc server-side (`server/workspace/collections/remoteView.ts`
  → `buildRemoteView`); the phone and the desktop preview both receive the same
  finished artifact.
- CSP is **stricter than desktop**: `connect-src 'none'` — data arrives via
  postMessage, so the view needs no network channel and the fetch/XHR/beacon
  exfil surface disappears.
- **1 MiB budget.** The srcdoc travels inside a Firestore command document
  (1 MiB cap), so the builder enforces `REMOTE_VIEW_MAX_BYTES` (~900 KB) and
  throws a byte-count error the agent can act on. The desktop preview surfaces
  the size as a caption while iterating.
- **Preview == phone capability, exactly.** The desktop preview answers only the
  same messages the phone runtime does (`mc-remote-get-items`, `mc-start-chat`),
  so "works in preview" stays meaningful.

Authoring spec for the agent: `packages/core/assets/helps/custom-view-remote.md`.
Register a mobile view with a `target` discriminator:

```jsonc
"views": [
  { "id": "phone", "label": "Phone", "target": "mobile", "file": "views/phone.html" }
]
```

Absent `target` means `desktop`, so every existing view keeps its exact behavior.

## Chat with image attachments

`startChat` seeds a visible chat from the phone: the verbatim `message`, an
optional `role`, and optional `attachments`. Because a command doc can't carry
full-resolution bytes, images go through **Firebase Storage** as a staging area:

1. The remote uploads bytes to `users/{uid}/uploads/{storage_id}` (it holds
   read/delete rights there).
2. `startChat` → `ingestAttachments` downloads each staged object into the
   workspace via `saveAttachment` (110 MiB cap, `storage_id` regex-guarded),
   **deletes the staging object**, and returns path-only `Attachment[]`.
3. `spawnSystemWorker` starts the chat.

Storage is staging only. Two orphan safeguards (for uploads whose host never
ran): **remote-side rollback** — the remote best-effort deletes its own staged
objects if `startChat` never gets a host ack — and a **Storage lifecycle TTL**
backstop (follow-up, not v1). See `plans/feat-remote-chat-image-attachments.md`.

---

## Offline queueing (`startChat` while the host is asleep)

The command channel is a **durable Firestore queue**, so `startChat` doesn't need
the host awake *now*. A remote can write the command (and stage its attachments)
while the host is offline; the host **drains everything on reconnect** because the
runner's `onSnapshot` reports every pre-existing `queued` doc as an `added` change
the instant it re-attaches. No flush call, no separate channel — the same
`commands` subcollection, treated slightly differently on both ends. See
`plans/feat-remote-offline-queue.md`.

Three optional, backward-compatible fields on the command doc drive it (absent ⇒
today's exact behaviour):

```jsonc
{ "createdAt": 1751760000000,   // enqueue time (epoch ms) — replay ordering
  "expiresAt": 1752364800000,   // deadline (epoch ms) — past it the host deletes it
  "queuedOffline": true }       // emitted while the host was offline
```

- **Best-effort drain order.** The runner sorts each drained batch by `createdAt`
  **in memory** (oldest first) to bias which command starts first — but commands
  are processed concurrently and **out-of-order completion is by design** (chat is
  asynchronous), so this is not a strict ordering guarantee. In-memory rather than
  `orderBy("createdAt")` on the query because a Firestore `orderBy` silently
  excludes pre-offline-queue docs that have no `createdAt`.
- **Expiry ⇒ delete, not error.** A command past `expiresAt` is removed entirely:
  the runner calls the host's `onExpire(command)` — which deletes the staged
  attachment uploads (`server/remoteHost/onExpire.ts`) — then `deleteDoc`s it. It
  never reaches a handler and leaves no `error` doc. Both steps are
  best-effort/idempotent, so a snapshot replay of the same expired doc is
  harmless. (Contrast a command that *ran* and failed validation — e.g. a stale
  role — which keeps its `error` so the phone can explain it.)
- **Cleanup ownership.** Every staged upload now has a definite reaper — the host
  on ingest-success, the host on expiry, or the remote on user-delete — so the
  Storage lifecycle TTL drops to a last-resort backstop for the one case nobody
  covers: a host that never reconnects at all.
- **TTL-below-expiry invariant.** The `expiresAt` horizon **must be shorter than**
  the Storage lifecycle TTL, or a still-valid queued command could find its staged
  attachment already swept. Chosen pair: **7-day expiry under a 14-day TTL.**
- **Protocol-gated.** Offline queueing requires the host to honour `expiresAt`, so
  it is advertised via `protocolVersion` (v2). A remote MUST see `protocolVersion
  >= 2` in the presence doc before queueing offline — a v1 host would ignore
  `expiresAt` and spawn stale chats on reconnect with uploads never cleaned up.
- The remote lists its own `queued` commands and can **delete** one before the
  host drains it (doc + staged uploads), and exempts `queuedOffline` commands from
  its ack-timeout rollback (that cleanup is now the host's / user's job). These
  are the mulmoserver-client half.

## API surface (`server/api/routes/remoteHost.ts`)

Bearer-guarded loopback routes (paths under `API_ROUTES.remoteHost` in
`src/config/apiRoutes.ts`). These start/stop the Firestore host loop — they are
**not** the command channel itself:

| Route | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/remote-host/connect` | `{ idToken }` | `{ status }` — signs in + starts the runner (idToken never logged) |
| `POST /api/remote-host/disconnect` | — | `{ status }` — stops the runner + signs out |
| `GET /api/remote-host/status` | — | `{ status }` where `status = { connected, uid }` |

---

## Frontend

- **`src/components/RemoteHostControl.vue`** — the only remote-host UI. A toolbar
  `phonelink` button (green when connected) with a popover showing online/offline,
  uid, and Connect/Disconnect. Connect runs the browser Google sign-in, extracts
  the `idToken`, and `apiPost`s to `/connect`. Popover help text links the mobile
  URL `https://mulmoserver.web.app` and hints at custom remote views.
- **`src/components/SidebarHeader.vue`** — mounts `<RemoteHostControl />` in the
  toolbar chrome row.
- **`src/config/firebaseConfig.ts`** (pure public web config, source of truth) +
  **`src/config/firebase.ts`** (browser SDK init) — project `mulmoserver`.
- i18n keys `remoteHost.*` across all `src/lang/*` locales.

There is **no in-app remote-view renderer** in this repo — mobile views render on
the external mulmoserver client. The desktop side only builds a *preview* of a
mobile view inside a phone-sized (390×844) sandboxed iframe in the collection's
view selector.

---

## Roadmap / provenance

Every phase's **host** side is shipped in this repo (rows marked _(planned)_ are
designed but not yet built); the outstanding half each names is the external
mulmoserver client (which depends on the published `@mulmoclaude/core` contract).
Design rationale lives in the plan files:

| Plan | Phase / feature |
|---|---|
| `plans/feat-remote-host-firestore-list-collections.md` | Phase 1 — channel + auth + hostRunner + `listCollections` |
| `plans/feat-remote-collection-view.md` | Phase 2 — `getCollection` / paged records |
| `plans/feat-remote-custom-view.md` | Phase 3 — `getRemoteView` sandboxed srcdoc + postMessage bridge |
| `plans/feat-remote-writable-view.md` | Phase 4 — `mutateRemoteViewItem` (host-enforced policy) |
| `plans/feat-remote-view-images.md` | Phase 5 — `getRemoteViewItems` image thumbnails |
| `plans/feat-remote-chat-image-attachments.md` | `startChat` attachments + `ingestAttachments` |
| `plans/feat-1955-remote-host-help.md` | Popover help text + mobile URL link |
| `plans/feat-remote-host-capabilities.md` | Capability advertisement in the presence doc (`HostPresence`, `protocolVersion`) |
| `plans/feat-remote-offline-queue.md` | _(planned)_ Queue `startChat` while the host is offline — drain on reconnect, `expiresAt` + host-side expiry delete (doc + attachments), user-managed pending list |

> **Not to be confused with** MulmoBridge's "relay" (a Cloudflare Workers message
> relay — see `docs/message_apps/relay/`). That is a separate messaging feature;
> the remote-host relay is Firestore itself.
