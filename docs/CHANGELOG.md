## [Unreleased]

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (7)

presentMulmoScript `filePath` base clarified (the wire form `stories/<name>.json` has been **artifacts-relative, not workspace-relative**, ever since #284 moved the stories dir to `artifacts/stories/` — the tool description was never updated):

- **`@mulmoclaude/mulmoscript-plugin@0.2.1`** — tool schema no longer calls `filePath` "workspace-relative"; it now states the path is resolved against the workspace's `artifacts/` directory. Resolvers (`normalizeStoryPath`, server `resolveStory`) additionally accept the workspace-relative spelling `artifacts/stories/<rel>` the stale description taught, normalizing it to the canonical `stories/<rel>` wire form (responses always echo the canonical form). A bare `artifacts/foo.json` keeps its historical meaning (a file of that name under the stories dir).
- **`@mulmoclaude/core@0.22.1`** — `helps/mulmoscript.md` now states where relative `{ "kind": "path" }` media sources resolve from: the script file's own directory (`<workspace>/artifacts/stories/`), not the workspace root.

---

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (6)

Package release riding PR #2137 (presentMulmoScript extraction, phase 3a of `plans/feat-mulmoscript-plugin.md`):

- **`@mulmoclaude/mulmoscript-plugin@0.2.0`** — the entire server ops layer moves into a new Node-only **`./server`** entry so any host runs the SAME mulmocast orchestration: all op cores (probes, beat/character rendering, audio, uploads, movie/PDF pipelines, background `autoGenerateMovie`), the edge-triggered generation tracker + `pendingGenerations` snapshot, the dispatch kind router (`createMulmoScriptDispatchHandler`, carrying the realpath symlink-containment guard), and the GraphAI provider-error capture. Host transport is injected via `MulmoScriptServerBackend`; `mulmocast` + `graphai` become peers (must resolve to the host's single hoisted copies). Review hardening: `toStoryRef` relativizes against the realpath stories root; `fileToDataUri` reads asynchronously. MulmoClaude's four host-side files (`mulmo-script-ops.ts`, `mulmoscript-builtin.ts`, `events/mulmoscript-generation.ts`, `utils/mulmoErrorCapture.ts`) collapsed into one ~60-line binding (`server/plugins/mulmoscript-server.ts`). MulmoTerminal wiring is phase 3b.

---

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (5)

Package release riding PR #2133 (presentMulmoScript extraction, phases 1+2 of `plans/feat-mulmoscript-plugin.md`):

- **`@mulmoclaude/mulmoscript-plugin@0.1.0`** — NEW shared package for the `presentMulmoScript` tool, extracted so MulmoTerminal can import it like `@mulmoclaude/{markdown,form,chart,html}-plugin` (phase 3 does that wiring). **Server core (`.`)**: tool definition, body validators (former `mulmoScriptValidate.ts`), and save / reopen / update-beat / update-script logic against the generic `files.artifacts` capability. **`./vue` + `./style.css`**: the 1,950-line storyboard View + Preview with their own 8-locale i18n; the View reaches every backend through kind-discriminated `useRuntime().dispatch` envelopes, hears generation progress on the plugin pubsub `generation` channel (SSE streams and the `useActiveSession()` watcher both retired; a `pendingGenerations` snapshot dispatch covers views mounted mid-generation), and takes host transport (`chatSessionId`, authenticated `fetchMediaBlob`) via the optional host-adapter injection. MulmoClaude's route bodies moved to shared ops (`mulmo-script-ops.ts`) backing both the legacy REST routes and the new dispatch handler. Review hardening on the way in: non-negative-integer `beatIndex` validation on both surfaces, string-typed query guards, realpath symlink containment restored host-side (`guardStoryWirePath`), edge-triggered (refcounted) generation events, and stale-response guards on every View probe/mutator.

Hosts wiring the package's save/update executes must apply a realpath symlink-containment guard on wire paths — the package's own guard is lexical (see the phase-3 notes in the plan).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

**Google, without the setup.** Linking now takes a click and a consent screen — no Google Cloud project, no client JSON. And the agent can reach Tasks and Drive, not just Calendar.

### Highlights

#### Link Google with no Cloud setup (#2131, #2135)

Google requires a client secret at its token endpoint even under PKCE, so users without their own Cloud project could not finish a link — the "OAuth クライアント認証情報が見つかりません" dead end. The **mulmoserver broker** (receptron/mulmoserver#54) now applies that secret. It is **stateless**: it stores no token and no authorization code, and its callback hands the *code* — never a token — back to your machine, which does the exchange itself. **Refresh tokens still live only on your machine** (`~/.config/mulmo/`), so there is no central store to breach.

- Bring your own OAuth client? A **desktop** client JSON in `~/.secrets/` still wins and keeps the entire flow local — self-hosters lose nothing.
- Tokens record which client minted them (`issuedVia`), so renewals use the right one. Existing links keep working untouched.
- Hardening: the broker URL must be HTTPS unless loopback, and the consent URL it returns must be `https://accounts.google.com` before any browser opens.

#### Google Tasks and Drive tools (#2115, #2132)

The `google` tool gains seven kinds: list task lists, list / add / complete tasks, and list / create / read Drive files. Drive is `drive.file`-scoped — the app only ever sees files **it** created, never your wider Drive.

> These shipped in packages on 2026-07-17 but could not reach `npx mulmoclaude@1.1.1` users: a 0.x caret range (`^0.1.1`) does not cross a minor, so the launcher never resolved them. This release is what actually delivers them.

#### Host-neutral link guidance (#2128, #2130)

The unlinked-state guidance named MulmoClaude-only flows, misdirecting MulmoTerminal users (the plugin runs on both). Wording is now host-neutral; each host's own help carries the specific steps.

Ships `@mulmoclaude/core@0.22.0`, `@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.2.1`, `@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.11.4`.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-17

Follow-up to 1.1.0: the Google OAuth token store becomes host-neutral.

### Changed

- **Google token path** — the refresh token moves from `~/.config/mulmoclaude/google-token.json` to `~/.config/mulmo/google-token.json` (the engine is shared with MulmoTerminal, so the directory drops the app branding). Existing tokens migrate automatically on first read: an atomic non-clobbering copy (`COPYFILE_EXCL`, mode 600 preserved, TOCTOU-safe) plus a legacy-path fallback read so a failed migration never makes a linked account look unlinked. (#2122, #2124)

Ships `@mulmoclaude/core@0.20.1` and `@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.1.1`.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17

**Google Calendar integration, end to end** — link once, then use it from the chat agent, the settings screen, and your phone. Plus per-beat controls for mulmoScript and collection engine consolidation.

### Highlights

#### Google Calendar integration (#2108 → #2110, #2111 → #2113, #2114 → #2120)

- **Local desktop OAuth (loopback + PKCE)**: the refresh token is stored only on your machine, never sent to any cloud — the gcloud / gh CLI trust model. One consent covers `calendar.events`, `tasks`, and `drive.file` (Tasks / Drive tools land later, #2115).
- **Settings → Plugins → Google**: link / status / unlink UI, with guidance when the OAuth client JSON is missing or ambiguous (#2113).
- **Chat agent `google` tool** (new `@mulmoclaude/google-plugin` preset, `personal` role): list upcoming events and create events by asking in plain language. When the account isn't linked, the agent reads the new error-recovery help and walks you through linking (#2120).
- **Phone remote commands** `google.calendar.createEvent` / `listEvents` over the Firestore command channel — the token stays on the host (#2110).
- Strict shared RFC3339 validation (offset required, impossible dates / out-of-range offsets rejected) hardened through four Codex review iterations.

#### mulmoScript: per-beat generate / play (#2119)

Generate or play each beat individually from the script editor, with real generation errors surfaced instead of silent failures.

#### Collections engine consolidation (#2116, #2118)

Collection rollups, and `manageCollection` extracted into `@mulmoclaude/core/collection/server` so both hosts share one engine.

### Fixed

- Malformed stored collection files downgrade to a row rejection instead of failing the whole merge-mode put (#2118).

### Docs / internal

- Collection egress documentation (#2117); multi-file attachment regression test (#2109); dependency refresh (#2106, #2123); shipped-plan archive sweep (#2112).

Ships `@mulmoclaude/core@0.20.0`, `@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.1.0`, `@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.11.2`.

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (4)

Package releases riding PR #2132 (Google Tasks / Drive tools, issue #2115):

- **`@mulmoclaude/core@0.21.0`** — new Tasks engine (list lists / list / create / complete / delete, `@default` list alias) and Drive engine under the `drive.file` scope (list / multipart create / text-only read / delete). Multipart uploads use a per-request random boundary re-derived until it collides with no part, and `assertSafeMimeType` refuses non-token MIME values (part-header injection). The Calendar REST plumbing is extracted into a shared `apiClient.ts` (timeout, per-API 403 hint, error truncation, field mapping). `assets/helps/error-recovery.md` gains per-API 403 guidance plus the "Drive only sees this app's files" explanation.
- **`@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.2.0`** — seven new kinds on the `google` tool: `taskListsList` / `tasksList` / `tasksCreate` / `tasksComplete` / `driveList` / `driveCreate` / `driveRead`. The description states the Drive visibility limit and the date-precision `due` so the agent can't over-promise.
- **`@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.11.3`** — core peer range widened to `^0.21.0`; no functional changes.

Existing grants already carry `tasks` + `drive.file` (requested since core 0.20.0), so no re-link is needed.

---

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (3)

Package releases riding PR #2130 (host-neutral link guidance, issue #2128):

- **`@mulmoclaude/core@0.20.2`** — the `getGoogleAccessToken()` not-linked error drops MulmoClaude-only wording; hosts' own help carries the specific link steps.
- **`@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.1.2`** — the tool prompt and `status` guidance say "link their Google account in this app's settings" (MulmoTerminal has no "Settings → Plugins → Google" and no `yarn google:auth`); the README documents both hosts' actual flows.

---

## npm packages — 2026-07-17 (2)

Package releases riding PR #2124 (host-neutral Google token path, issue #2122):

- **`@mulmoclaude/core@0.20.1`** — the Google token store moves to the host-neutral `~/.config/mulmo/google-token.json` (the engine is shared with MulmoTerminal). Pre-0.20.1 tokens migrate automatically via an atomic non-clobbering copy (`COPYFILE_EXCL`, mode 600 preserved, TOCTOU-safe) with a legacy-path fallback read so a failed migration never strands a linked user. `assets/helps/error-recovery.md` updated.
- **`@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.1.1`** — tool prompt / docs follow the new path; core range `^0.20.1`.

---

## npm packages — 2026-07-17

Package releases riding PR #2120 (agent-facing Google Calendar tool, issue #2114):

- **`@mulmoclaude/core@0.20.0`** — new server-only `./google` subpath: the local Google OAuth engine extracted from the host — loopback + PKCE consent (`authorizeGoogle`), token store at `~/.config/mulmoclaude/google-token.json` (mode 600, atomic writes with the Windows transient-rename retry), single-flight auth-flow manager, Calendar v3 REST helpers, and the strict shared RFC3339 validator (`isIsoDateTimeWithOffset`, rejecting offset-less / impossible / out-of-range values). Adds the Google recovery section to `assets/helps/error-recovery.md`; `google-auth-library` becomes a core dependency. Consent scopes: `calendar.events`, `tasks`, `drive.file`.
- **`@mulmoclaude/google-plugin@0.1.0`** — initial release. Server-only runtime plugin exposing one `google` tool to the chat agent (`status` / `calendarListEvents` / `calendarCreateEvent`), dispatching into `@mulmoclaude/core/google` so every surface shares one locally stored grant. Preset plugin, gated to the `personal` role.
- **`@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.11.2`** — dependency alignment: `@mulmoclaude/core` range widened to `^0.20.0`; no functional changes.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-14

MulmoClaude reaches **1.0** — the first stable release. Functionally it builds directly on 0.9.7, adding **Web Push on task finish** (get a push on your phone the moment the answer to a question you asked is ready) and a launcher fix that loads `.env` from the directory you launch from. 18 non-merge commits since 0.9.7.

### Highlights

#### Web Push on task finish (#2086)

Enable **Settings → Notifications → Web Push** to get a push on your registered devices when a turn you started finishes — the "ask a question, step away, get pinged when the answer's ready" flow, working even with the browser tab closed as long as the host machine is up. Only **human-initiated** turns fire it (scheduler / skill / bridge / system turns are excluded), and only while the **RemoteHost** channel is connected (that's what supplies the Firebase sign-in) — otherwise it's a silent no-op. The send core is the new auth-agnostic **`@mulmobridge/web-push`** package, extracted so MulmoClaude and MulmoTerminal share one source of truth for the mulmoserver `sendPush` wire contract; device registration and delivery stay server-side (mulmoserver#46).

### Fixed

- **Launcher loads `<launch-dir>/.env`** (#2081) — `npx mulmoclaude` now reads a `.env` in the directory you launch from, so `GEMINI_API_KEY` (and other env vars) take effect without exporting them by hand. Previously only the isolated `~/mulmoclaude` workspace was consulted.

### Changed

- Dependency refresh (#2088).

### `@mulmoclaude/core@0.13.1` - 2026-07-14

- **Docs (#2081)**: the Gemini API-key help now tells users to put `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file **in the directory they launch MulmoClaude from** (not the isolated `~/mulmoclaude` workspace), matching the launcher's new launch-dir `.env` loading. Ships via `assets/helps/gemini.md`.

📦 npm: [`mulmoclaude@1.0.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mulmoclaude/v/1.0.0)

## [0.9.7] - 2026-07-14

Chat input no longer locks while the agent is running — messages you type are queued and flushed in order once the run finishes. RemoteHost (driving MulmoClaude from a phone) now persists its Firebase session in the browser and reconnects across server/browser restarts, without a re-login popup — bundled via `@mulmoclaude/core@0.13.0`. 25 non-merge commits since 0.9.6.

### Highlights

#### Chat input: queue sends while the agent runs (#2067)

The composer no longer disables while a run is in progress — messages you type are buffered and sent in order once the agent is free, instead of the input locking. The buffer is scoped per session, and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter inserts a newline without triggering the slash menu.

#### RemoteHost session persistence (#2073, #2075)

A host's Firebase session is now parked in the browser and restored after a server or browser restart, so a phone paired to the host stays connected without a re-login popup. Reconnect is non-destructive: a transient network failure keeps the live session, while an expired or malformed session blob is dropped rather than retried forever. Shipped in `@mulmoclaude/core@0.13.0` (see the sub-note below for the API surface).

### Fixed

- e2e-live CI: pinned the auth token to stop an intermittent 401 flake caused by a token-regeneration race (#2069).

### Documentation

- Documented the MCP stdio-under-Docker opt-in (`hostExecInDocker`, a per-server toggle) and environment-variable passthrough, propagated across all README translations, with a plain-language "Short version" lead and a Japanese edition of the sandbox guide (#2071). The feature itself shipped earlier (#1421); this release documents it.

### `@mulmoclaude/core@0.13.0` - 2026-07-13

RemoteHost session persistence (receptron/mulmoserver#50, case A'): a host's Firebase session is parked in the browser and restored after a server restart, without a re-login popup. First core release carrying this API (#2074) and the mulmoclaude-wiring hardening (#2076).

- **New API**: `createHostSessionPersistence()` (seed/export-able Firebase Auth persistence) and `createRemoteHostSession(config)` — `open(seedBlob?, validate?)` / `close()` / `exportSession()` / `onSessionChange()`. New exports: `isSeedableBlob`, `RemoteHostSessionValidate`, `HostAuthPersistenceClass`, `HostAuthPersistenceInstance`.
- **Fix (#2076)**: persistence is now a class as `initializeAuth` requires — fixes `INTERNAL ASSERTION FAILED: Expected a class definition` that broke `createRemoteHostSession.open()`. Non-destructive `(re)connect` via a pre-teardown `validate` hook (a failed sign-in / expired blob keeps the live session). Reconnect classifies expired/malformed blobs (drop) vs transient failures (keep), so a network blip no longer forces a re-login and a corrupt blob is not retried forever.

📦 npm: [`@mulmoclaude/core@0.13.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mulmoclaude/core/v/0.13.0)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-07-12

Resolves the `handlePermission not found` MCP-broker failure family end-to-end — one error symptom with three distinct root causes (#2052 / #2056 / #2057) — so the Docker sandbox and scheduled runs stop losing all their tools at once. Adds a mobile-PWA QR code to the remote-host popover. 95 non-merge commits since 0.9.5.

### Highlights

#### MCP broker `handlePermission not found` — full family fix (#2058)

The sandbox MCP broker could fail to come up, dropping every `mcp__mulmoclaude__*` tool at once — so the CLI reported the missing permission-prompt tool instead of the real cause. Fixed across two layers, each with regression tests (mapped in `plans/mcp-broker-availability-matrix.md`):

- **Windows junction fallback now covers every workspace scope (#2052)** — the `/app/pkg_modules` fallback previously covered only `@mulmoclaude/*`, so `@mulmobridge/*` dangled inside the Linux container and the broker died at load. Verified on real Windows CI (WSL2 + native `dockerd`, real NTFS junctions).
- **npx nested `node_modules` mounted (#2056)** — when npm nests deps in the launcher's own `node_modules` instead of hoisting them, they are now bind-mounted into the container.
- **Scheduler startup race (#2057)** — a spawned chat's broker can lose the startup race to the CLI's first tool call. Now same-minute firings are staggered (capped to half a tick), a lost race is auto-recovered by replaying the turn once (guarded against double-execution and aborts), and a spawned-but-failed run records its real error instead of a false `"success"`.

#### Remote host: mobile PWA QR code (#2054)

The remote-host popover now shows a QR code for the mobile PWA, so pairing a phone no longer requires typing the URL by hand.

### Fixed

- `isTestEnv` no longer misdetects any path containing "test" (which caused `yarn dev` 401s) — it exact-matches argv now (#2064).
- npm `file:` specifiers emit POSIX separators, fixing Windows CI installs (#2048).
- Whisper absorbs a late partial-file open error during model download instead of crashing the stream (#2046, #2047).

### Changed

- Large internal refactors to clear the `max-lines-per-function` lint ratchet across whisper, relay, and several composables (#2049, #2050, #2051, #2053, #2060, #2045, #2044, #2042, #2041, #2040, #2039).
- README / MANIFEST now lead with the product "nurture" vision (#2061, #2062).
- Dependency refresh (#2065).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-07-08

Windows Docker sandbox is now fully functional end-to-end (the ESM half of the resolver gap #1946 / #1982 landed alongside the CJS fix from 0.9.4), HEIC / HEIF attachments transparently convert to JPEG on upload with in-browser preview, and a **user-extensible sandbox CSP** lets the runtime whitelist third-party origins through `config/csp.json` instead of hard-coding them. Remote host gains offline queueing (mobile requests hold until the host comes back). The lint suite got a deep clean: `sonarjs/assertions-in-tests` is now `error`, so an assertion-less test can't slip in unnoticed. 23 non-merge commits since 0.9.4.

### Highlights

#### Windows Docker sandbox: end-to-end fix (#1982)
- New `server/agent/mcp-esm-loader.mjs` + `mcp-esm-bootstrap.mjs` — an ESM resolver hook registered via `tsx --import` on the MCP child in Docker mode. NODE_PATH is CJS-only per Node's spec, so the previous 0.9.4 fix restored preset loading but left static ESM imports (`import { readXPost } from "@mulmoclaude/x-plugin"`) broken. Now every `@mulmoclaude/*` specifier resolves.
- Windows CI probe (`test/sandbox-repro/probe.ts` + `.github/workflows/docker_sandbox_windows.yaml`) grew an ESM `import()` step, so this class of regression can't slip through again.
- **No-op on Linux / macOS** — the hook's fallback only fires when primary resolution fails; the ESM loader is unchanged everywhere else.

#### HEIC / HEIF / TIFF / BMP / AVIF attachments (#1996)
- Uploader auto-converts these formats to JPEG server-side before the chat surface sees them (heic-convert on the launcher deps).
- Pre-send preview chip decodes HEIC in the browser (#2000), so the confirmation thumbnail is legible instead of a broken image.

#### User-extensible sandbox CSP (#1989)
- Sandboxed collection views can now whitelist third-party origins via workspace `config/csp.json`.
- A CSP-violation notice + boot-time warnings surface misconfigurations to the user instead of failing silently.

#### Remote host offline queueing (step 1 of #1993)
- Mobile companion's `startChat` requests queue while the host is offline; the host + `@mulmoclaude/core` layer replay them once the presence doc goes live.
- `advertise host capabilities in the presence doc` (#1992) lands as the discovery half — mobile now knows what the host supports before submitting.

#### Lint: assertions-in-tests as an error (batches #1999 / #2001 / #2005)
- 26 flagged tests (server / utils / plugins node:test + e2e Playwright specs) rewritten to wrap the target call in `assert.doesNotThrow(...)` / `assert.doesNotReject(...)` — no semantic change, contracts made explicit.
- Includes a new real boundary test for `deleteProjectSkill`'s user-scope refusal path (was an empty placeholder before), driven by a `userDir` seam so the guard is actually exercised.
- Rule promoted to `error` in `eslint.config.mjs` — CI blocks a new assertion-less test.

#### Files: "Open in OS" button (#1985)
- Binary / unsupported previews get an OS-native open button so the file view isn't a dead end when MulmoClaude can't render inline.

#### Sandbox: allow collection view downloads (#1997)
- File downloads now work from sandboxed collection views (were being blocked by the iframe sandbox flags).

### Added
- ESM resolver hook + bootstrap for Windows Docker MCP child (#1982 / #1995).
- HEIC / HEIF / TIFF / BMP / AVIF → JPEG on upload + browser-side HEIC preview (#1996 / #2000).
- Sandbox CSP allowlist via `config/csp.json` + violation surface (#1989 / #1990).
- Remote host offline queue for `startChat` + host-capability advertisement (#1992 / #1993).
- Real unit coverage for `deleteProjectSkill` user-scope refusal via new `userDir` seam (#2001).
- Files view: "Open in OS" button for binary previews (#1985 / #1988).
- Smoke: resolve first-party deps from the workspace instead of public npm (#1994) — trims flakiness when a shared package is mid-publish.

### Changed
- `sonarjs/assertions-in-tests` promoted from `warn` to `error` (#2005). Every existing hit rewritten in advance across #1999 / #2001.
- Windows Docker CI probe now runs an ESM step (`docker_sandbox_windows.yaml`).
- `resolvePresetRoot` delegates to Node's resolver for NODE_PATH (#1984, tidies the fallback path #1974 introduced).
- `@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin` bumped to 0.7.4 in the workspace + published (#1987 for 0.7.1 → 0.7.4 range).
- Documentation: remote host guide (#1979) + launch plan re-centred on Collections (#1971).
- `remote-host` transport extracted into `@mulmoclaude/core` (#1980) — reusable across host + mobile pairs.

### Fixed
- Sandboxed collection view file downloads blocked by iframe flags (#1997).
- Ref-crossing derived fields in mobile `getItems` failing to resolve (#1978).
- The `mulmoclaude@0.9.5` launcher publish itself required a cascade publish of `@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.7.4` (skill §2 drift check covers only `@mulmobridge/*` scope). PR #2006 updates the skill so the manual `@mulmoclaude/*` check is now a documented step.

### Security
- User-extensible sandbox CSP (#1989) narrows what a sandboxed collection view can reach — the default remains locked down; only origins explicitly listed in `config/csp.json` are allowed through.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-07-05

Retrospective release entry for the `mulmoclaude@0.9.4` npm publish that shipped without a matching GitHub release. Focused on **Windows Docker sandbox recovery** (root of #1946) and a batch of **remote host / mobile-companion** improvements (session-history summaries, listSkills, attachments over Storage, capability advertisement). 19 non-merge commits since 0.9.3.

### Highlights

#### Windows Docker sandbox: CJS-side fix (#1946)
- `packages/mulmoclaude/package.json` gets a NODE_PATH fallback so `@mulmoclaude/*` workspace packages resolve inside the Linux container even when the yarn workspace symlinks (Windows junctions) dangle.
- Follow-up ESM half landed in 0.9.5; the 0.9.4 fix restored the preset loader path only.

#### Remote host / mobile companion polish
- **Remote view attachments** (#1954): mobile can now share photos / videos / PDFs into a chat via Storage, without pulling them through localhost.
- **listSkills + free-form `startChat`** (#1947): mobile can enumerate host skills and start chats without picking a role first.
- **List accounting books + choose role on startChat** (#1962): mobile-side workflow selects a role at chat creation.
- **Popover UI help** (#1955): explanations for the presence popover so users understand the same-Google-account contract.

#### Collections + Files
- **Dynamic collection icons** based on data state (#1900 / #1957).
- **Hide agent-internal top-level dirs by default** (#1896 / #1963) — the file tree stops leaking `chat/` / `summaries/` unless the user opts in.

#### Session history: summary-first
- **Summary-first, hover for full** (#1958 / #1959) — the session list surfaces the LLM-generated summary; hovering reveals the full first message.
- **Journal + chat-index: configurable mode + always-on origin filter** (#1944 follow-ups: #1949 / #1951).

### Added
- Remote-view attachments via Storage (#1954).
- Mobile `listSkills` + free-form `startChat` (#1947); accounting book picker (#1962).
- Popover UI help copy on the remote-host presence indicator (#1955).
- Dynamic collection icons (#1957).
- Session-history summary-first with hover-for-full (#1959).
- Files: hide agent-internal top-level dirs by default (#1963).
- Docs: consolidate what runs in Docker vs host (#1966); Remote Access README section (#1970); CLAUDE.md rule forbidding preemptive launcher version bumps in `chore(release)` (#1948).

### Changed
- Journal + chat-index: configurable mode + always-on origin filter (#1944 / #1949 / #1951).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-03

Two threads dominate this release: **writable remote custom views for the mobile companion** (phase 3–5 of the remote-view work — mobile-optimised LLM-generated views, update/delete over the Firestore channel, and inlined workspace image thumbnails so the phone doesn't reach localhost) and a **batch of correctness fixes** across chat UI, long-message rendering, collection deep-links, notification icon clashes, and the billing recipe. Plus the new CI gate that enforces launcher ↔ shared-package sync (root cause of #1920). 38 non-merge commits since 0.9.2.

### Added

- **Remote custom views — phase 3** ([#1932](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1932)) — collection views can now specify `target: "mobile"`, and the desktop shows a phone-frame preview. `getRemoteView` handler lets the mobile companion (mulmoserver) fetch these views over the Firestore command channel.
- **Remote custom views — phase 4** ([#1933](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1933)) — writable mobile views: `mutateRemoteView` handler supports update/delete of records from the phone, with derived-field resolution + clone-safe preview pages so edits round-trip cleanly.
- **Remote custom views — phase 5** ([#1938](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1938)) — workspace image thumbnails inlined into the mobile response (via `sharp`), so the phone never has to reach localhost. Includes thumbnail budget mutation, invalid-id reporting on update, and log hygiene per review.

### Changed

- **launcher-sync CI gate — strict lockstep** ([#1927](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1927)) — added invariants 4 (launcher range lower bound == workspace source, strict) and 5 (`gui-chat-protocol` peer dep major.minor == launcher pin major.minor) to `scripts/mulmoclaude/launcherSync.mjs`. Enforces the class of drift that caused [#1920](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1920) at PR time.
- **`bin/mulmoclaude.js` reads version from `package.json`** ([#1925](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1925)) — no more hardcoded string that silently drifts every publish. `--version` now always matches the shipped `package.json`.
- **Chat-index scheduler skips unchanged sessions** ([#1930](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1930), tracking [#1929](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1929)) — before this fix, the hourly `system:chat-index` scheduler re-summarised every session every hour regardless of whether the jsonl had changed. Now only sessions whose jsonl mtime is newer than the last index get re-processed; the CLI call rate drops from `O(sessions × 24)` to `O(actually-touched sessions × 24)` per day on a busy workspace.
- **billing-clients-worklog recipe reconciles pre-existing data** ([#1941](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1941), tracking [#1626](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1626)) — the recipe now includes a mandatory reconcile step that inventories existing worklog rows, slugifies non-slug `clientId` values (with slug-contract enforcement + empty/oversize fallbacks + collision detection), and rewrites worklog rows in lockstep. Prevents the "setup looks done but ref links break" trap when a user has legacy worklog data with display-name `clientId` values.
- **Session role icons** ([#1942](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1942), tracking [#1684](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1684)) — General → `auto_awesome`, Debug → `bug_report`, unknown-role fallback → `smart_toy`. Was `star` on all three, colliding with the PinToggle's ★ (favourite) glyph for collection shortcuts.

### Fixed

- **Chat UI silently loses events mid-turn** ([#1934](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1934), tracking [#1915](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1915)) — three complementary fixes so the "考え中…" indicator can never stick when the server actually finished. Immediate `isRunning=false` on `session_finished`, new `usePubSub().onReconnect()` API for socket.io reconnect catch-up, and a `document.visibilitychange` handler that covers Safari's silent tab throttling (WS stays "connected" server-side while delivery stops client-side).
- **Safari freezes on model degenerate-repetition output** ([#1936](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1936), tracking [#1863](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1863)) — cap the string fed into `marked()` at 100k chars in the text-response view. Opus 4.8's repeat-word bug could produce 30k `<p>` elements per message; Safari's layout/paint froze for minutes. Now shows a truncation banner + preview slice; the full raw text is still one click away via the Copy button. Localised across all 8 locales.
- **`?selected=<id>` deep-link no longer forces calendar view** ([#1939](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1939), tracking [#1675](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1675)) — Bell-notification deep-links now open the record modal in the user's saved view mode (table / kanban / calendar) instead of always switching to calendar and writing "calendar" into localStorage. e2e tests updated to assert the new contract.
- **`sharp` was missing from launcher `dependencies`** ([#1938](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1938)) — the remote-view thumbnail flow added a `sharp` import to `server/*` but the launcher `package.json` never declared it, so `npx mulmoclaude` would `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on the first thumbnail request. `deps.mjs` gate would have caught it; adding the entry closes the gap.
- **CodeQL false-positive in remote-view sessionId sanitisation** ([#1937](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1937)) — switched to `path.basename` as the CodeQL-recognised path sanitizer; sessionId is now sanitised at every entry point.
- **`chat-index` scheduler interval relaxed to 6h** ([#1931](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1931)) — hourly was excessive given the skip-unchanged optimisation; 6h keeps the summary fresh enough for the picker without CLI cost.

### Internal

- **Root ↔ launcher ↔ plugin peer dep sync gate** ([#1923](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1923)) — new `scripts/mulmoclaude/launcherSync.mjs` audits every PR for three invariants (root ↔ launcher common dep range identical, workspace source satisfies launcher range, plugin `peerDependencies` satisfied by launcher pins). Catches the [#1920](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1920) class of bug at PR time.
- **CHANGELOG.md for 0.9.2 with PR / issue links** ([#1926](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1926)) — retroactive entry documenting the 30 PRs shipped in 0.9.2.
- **Fix plan archived** ([#1935](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1935)) — `plans/fix-1915-chat-ui-stuck-mid-turn.md` → `plans/done/` after merge.

### Cascade publishes

- `@mulmoclaude/core` 0.7.0 → 0.7.1 → 0.8.0 → 0.8.1
- `@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin` 0.6.0 → 0.7.0
- `@mulmobridge/client` 0.1.4 → 0.1.5

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-02

Two threads dominate this release: a **critical fresh-install regression on npm** (#1920 — bundled plugins silently dropped by `ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency`), and the first two phases of a **mobile remote channel** so a companion app can browse a workspace over Firestore. Plus share-as-zip landing in three phases, mermaid diagrams inside markdown finally rendering as diagrams, session-role continuity across `/switch` and HTTP `/connect`, a wiki-engine extraction into `@mulmoclaude/core/wiki`, and a new CI gate that catches the class of drift that caused #1920 in the first place. 30 PRs merged since 0.9.1.

### Added

- **Mobile remote — Firestore command channel, phase 1a** ([#1909](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1909)) — login UI, presence heartbeat (60 s), and host runner lifecycle (`connect` / `disconnect`, atomic status transitions, listener-death → offline reconciliation). Commands live under `users/{uid}/hosts/mulmoclaude/commands` and are isolated per user by the standard `request.auth.uid == uid` Firestore rule.
- **Phase 1b — `listCollections` handler + popover auto-close** ([#1914](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1914)) — the mobile remote can list a workspace's collections; the connect popover auto-closes on connect / disconnect.
- **Phase 2 — read-only paginated data handlers** ([#1918](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1918)) — `getCollection(slug, offset?, limit?)`, `getFeed(slug, offset?, limit?)` (identical shape so mobile reuses one card renderer), `listShortcuts()`, `listFeeds()`. Pagination is mandatory because Firestore caps a single command document at 1 MiB; `limit` clamped to `[1, 200]` (default 50).
- **Phase 2 — `startChat` handler** ([#1922](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1922)) — the mobile remote can start a chat targeting either a collection or a specific record. Rejects unknown slugs before spawning; refuses feeds (no slash-command surface); validates slug / itemId as whitespace-free string tokens.
- **Share as zip — phase 1** ([#1892](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1892)) — bundle an HTML artifact + its assets (images, CSS, JS) into one self-contained zip.
- **Share as zip — phase 1b** ([#1901](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1901)) — Download (zip) button in the HTML view.
- **Share as zip — phase 1c** ([#1907](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1907)) — Download (zip) in the file-explorer HTML preview.
- **Share as zip — phase 3** ([#1910](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1910)) — markdown pages and wiki pages export as self-contained HTML zips, so a shared markdown note travels with its images and diagrams intact.
- **Mermaid fenced blocks render as diagrams** ([#1906](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1906), tracking [#1904](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1904)) — ` ```mermaid ` in any markdown-rendered surface (chat, wiki, markdown plugin) draws the diagram instead of showing raw source.
- **Session query counter + long-running (24 h+) filter** ([#1885](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1885)) — per-user query counter and a picker filter to isolate multi-day sessions.
- **Exclude scheduler sessions from long-running filter** ([#1887](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1887), tracking [#1886](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1886)) — background scheduler-triggered sessions no longer clutter the long-running view.
- **`chat-index` summaries use Sonnet + wider input window** ([#1884](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1884)) — better summaries for long chats.
- **Accounting: any month-end as fiscal year end** ([#1890](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1890)) — previously locked to quarter-end months; now any month.

### Changed

- **Wiki engine extracted into `@mulmoclaude/core/wiki`** ([#1875](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1875)) — pure engine (parse, link resolution, backlinks, snapshot policy) moved into shared core so mulmoclaude, mulmoserver, and downstream tools all share one implementation.
- **Wiki fs / YAML server read-engine extracted into `@mulmoclaude/core/wiki/server`** ([#1876](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1876)) — follow-up to #1875 that finishes the extraction on the server side.
- **`CHAT_DIR` sourced from `WORKSPACE_DIRS`** ([#1903](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1903), tracking [#1902](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1902)) — one single source of truth for the chat directory path.
- **`publish-mulmoclaude` skill pins the public npm registry** ([#1924](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1924)) — avoids install-time picking up a scope-override registry.
- Routine dependency + tooling updates: [#1872](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1872), [#1873](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1873), [#1877](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1877), [#1919](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1919).

### Fixed

- **Bundled plugins fail to load on fresh install ([#1920](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1920) / [#1921](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1921))** — `mulmoclaude@0.9.1` pinned `gui-chat-protocol@0.4.0` but three bundled plugins declared `peerDependencies.gui-chat-protocol: ^0.3.0`. npm papered over the conflict with a silent `ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency` override; the plugins then failed their runtime handshake and were dropped from the registered plugin set (`[plugins/preset] loaded requested=4 succeeded=1`, followed by `mcp__mulmoclaude__handlePermission not found`). All 8 workspace plugins (`form`, `markdown`, `spotify`, `email`, `recipe-book`, `bookmarks`, `debug`, `edgar`) bumped their `gui-chat-protocol` peer dep to `^0.4.0` with a patch bump. Enormous thanks to [@drippinghydrangea-a11y](https://github.com/drippinghydrangea-a11y) for the extremely detailed reproduction that pinpointed the peer-dep gap.
- **Bridge chat turns serialize per external chat** ([#1879](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1879), tracking [#1878](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1878)) — two rapid messages from the same external chat no longer race each other into the same session.
- **`/switch` preserves session role** ([#1893](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1893), tracking [#1888](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1888)) — reconnecting an existing chat via `/switch` no longer resets its role to the default.
- **HTTP `/connect` resolves target session's role** ([#1895](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1895), tracking [#1894](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1894)) — when a bridge reconnects a chat by session ID, the role is looked up server-side instead of being redeclared client-side.
- **`/connect` rejects unsafe `chatSessionId`** ([#1905](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1905)) — defense-in-depth follow-up to [#1895](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1895) — early reject at the handler entry point with a matching test.
- **Canonical `dataPath` threaded into ingest / action seed prompts** ([#1897](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1897), tracking [#1891](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1891)) — action templates and ingest steps now receive the collection's canonical `dataPath` instead of re-deriving it, with cross-platform (Windows POSIX) + ReDoS defenses in the sanitiser.
- **Mermaid quoted labels + HTML in SVG labels** ([#1917](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1917), tracking [#1916](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1916)) — fixed a double-encoding bug that made `<foo>` in Mermaid labels arrive at the renderer as `&lt;foo&gt;`; unlocked HTML fragments inside labels.
- **Duplicate close-comments on auto-triaged PRs** ([#1871](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1871), follow-up to [#1869](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/issues/1869)) — CI no longer double-comments when the auto-triager closes a PR.

### Internal

- **New CI gate — root ↔ launcher deps + plugin peer dep sync** ([#1923](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1923)) — every PR that touches `packages/mulmoclaude/package.json`, the root `package.json`, or any plugin's `peerDependencies` runs an auditor with three invariants: (1) root ↔ launcher common deps have identical version ranges, (2) launcher `@mulmoclaude/*` / `@mulmobridge/*` ranges satisfy the workspace source version, (3) bundle-target plugin `peerDependencies` are satisfied by the launcher's pins. The gate catches the exact class of drift that caused #1920.

### Removed

- **Shared-package version-bump CI guard** — the `Shared package version bump` workflow (and its `scripts/check-shared-pkg-bumps.mjs`) required every PR touching a shared `@mulmoclaude/*` package to also bump that package's `version`. In practice this forced every core-touching PR to edit the same `version` line, so any two such PRs raced into a merge conflict on it. The guard is removed; keeping shared packages bumped before publish is now a convention (see CLAUDE.md), not a CI gate. (Reverts the guard added in [#1737](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1737) / [#1788](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1788).)

### Cascade publishes

- `@mulmoclaude/form-plugin` 0.1.3 → 0.1.4
- `@mulmoclaude/markdown-plugin` 0.1.7 → 0.1.10
- `@mulmoclaude/spotify-plugin` 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
- `@mulmoclaude/email-plugin` 0.1.3 → 0.1.4
- `@mulmoclaude/recipe-book-plugin` 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
- `@mulmoclaude/bookmarks-plugin` 0.1.0 → 0.1.1
- `@mulmoclaude/debug-plugin` 0.2.0 → 0.2.1
- `@mulmoclaude/edgar-plugin` 0.1.1 → 0.1.2

### Known cosmetic issue

- `npx mulmoclaude@0.9.2 --version` prints `mulmoclaude 0.9.1` — the version string was hardcoded in `bin/mulmoclaude.js` and missed the sync bump. All runtime behaviour is correct. [#1925](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/pull/1925) makes the CLI read the version from `package.json` at runtime; the next release will pick it up.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-28

Three threads run through this release: **multi-registry collections**, **collection-import path unification**, and **agent self-service troubleshooting**. Plus a stack of UX / i18n polish, the Contribute side of the registry going GA with sanitisation + a confirm dialog + dummy-data prompt + fork flow, custom-view i18n in all 8 locales, accounting plugin self-contained i18n, CJK font fixes for both code blocks and PDFs, the Discover tab landing fully, and a feeds package extraction. The shared `@mulmoclaude/core` ratchets to 0.2.12 with cascade publishes for `bookmarks-plugin`, `recipe-book-plugin`, and `debug-plugin` (initial), plus `collection-plugin` 0.5.16. Workflow: 48 PRs since 0.9.0.

### Added

- **Multi-registry Discover** (#1837) — Discover tab now reads `~/mulmoclaude/config/collections-registries.json` to add custom registries alongside the official one. Each entry: `{ name, indexUrl, rawBaseUrl }`. The Discover cards carry an origin badge so users can tell which registry an entry came from; `previewCollection` and `performImport` accept the registry name to disambiguate collisions. Per-registry cache + stale-on-failure backoff keyed by `(name, indexUrl, rawBaseUrl)`, so editing URLs invalidates the cached index. `docs/collection-registries.md` documents file format + validation rules + per-registry isolation semantics.
- **Curated registry, Discover, and import-as-rename** (#1815 + #1817 + #1818 + #1819) — the official `receptron/mulmoclaude-collections` registry, the `/collections/discover` tab that lists it, server-side import into the workspace's `.claude/skills/`, and rename-on-collision (`movies-2`, `movies-3`, …) with an "Imported as" label.
- **Contribute (registry export) flow** (#1828 + #1830 + #1832 + #1835 + #1845) — Contribute icon on each Installed-tab collection card seeds a new chat with a sanitised template prompt. The agent generates 3-5 synthetic dummy records based on `schema.json` (privacy-safe by default — never copies real user records), builds the contribution bundle, runs `build-index.mjs` + `validate.mjs`, and opens a PR to the registry after user confirmation. A confirm dialog wraps the icon button so a stray click doesn't launch the agent.
- **Field-driven spawn from a record field** (#1820) — collection schema `spawn.every` accepts `{ fromField: "interval" }` so weekly / monthly branches off a record's own dropdown without splitting schemas.
- **Custom-view i18n** (#1842) — the custom-view HTML wrapper threads the host locale through to the sandboxed view via a `<meta name="mulmoclaude:locale">` tag and `document.documentElement.lang`, so views can pick up the user's language at render time.
- **Accounting plugin self-contained i18n** (#1838) — `@mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin` now ships its own 8-locale i18n inside the package instead of borrowing from the host, removing the runtime dependency on host i18n resources.
- **Feeds package extraction** (#1840 + #1843) — feeds engine + schema + paths moved to a dedicated subpath of `@mulmoclaude/core` (`./feeds`, `./feeds/server`, `./feeds/paths`), enabling MulmoTerminal to consume the feeds runtime. Plus shareable feed refresh registration so the same feed can be triggered from multiple surfaces.
- **Agent error-recovery help** (#1846) — new `config/helps/error-recovery.md` indexes the documented fix for common tool failures (gh/git/SSH in the sandbox, Marp PDF, registry import, build/workspace, plugin runtime). The system prompt now points the agent at it BEFORE asking the user a clarifying question on a failed tool call. CLAUDE.md rule mandates appending new diagnostics to that file.
- **Collections export bundle generation** (#1825) — `performExport` produces the `{ SKILL.md, schema.json, meta.json, manifest.json, [seed/items/*] }` bundle that the Contribute flow ships up to the registry, with strict input validation.
- **Imported-collection custom-view fallback** (#1836) — the custom-view file reader falls back to `data/skills/<slug>/views/` for project-source collections, so an imported collection's views render even though the bundle didn't mirror them through skill-bridge.

### Changed

- **Imports write to `data/skills/<slug>/` first** (#1839) — refactor unifies authored and imported collections on disk: both live at `data/skills/<slug>/`, mirrored to `.claude/skills/<slug>/` via the same skill-bridge allowlist (`SKILL.md`, `schema.json`, `templates/<safe>`). `.origin.json` (the imported-vs-authored marker) lives only on the data side. Editing an imported collection is now identical to editing an authored one; `rm -rf data/skills/<slug>/` deletes either kind through the existing bridge hook.
- **Write-then-prune mirror ordering** (#1839 follow-up) — mirror writes happen before pruning stale files, so a transient mirror failure can no longer leave `.claude/skills/<slug>/` empty.
- **Collections Contribute dummy data** (#1835) — replaces the "include my own records as seed?" question with an unconditional "generate 3-5 synthetic dummy records based on `schema.json`". Privacy-safe by default; the published bundle never contains real user data.
- **`packages/mulmoclaude/README.md` refresh** (#1849) — the npm-shown README catches up with the last year of features (collections, Marp, sandbox credentials, full bridges list). Also adds a `/publish-mulmoclaude` skill step to verify the README each release so this doesn't drift again.
- **CJK monospace fonts in code blocks** (#1829) — adds Windows CJK monospace fonts (`MS Gothic`, `BIZ UDGothic`) to the monospace stack across `src/index.css` and 11 plugin View files, plus the JSON editor's CodeMirror theme. Japanese inside code blocks renders correctly on Windows (was tofu). Bumps `@mulmoclaude/html-plugin` and `@mulmoclaude/markdown-plugin` for the shared CSS.
- **CJK fonts in PDF render** (#1826) — adds Hiragino / Yu Gothic / Meiryo / Noto Sans CJK JP fallback to the `MARKDOWN_CSS` body + Marp inline style so PDF exports of Japanese decks render the glyphs.
- **Custom view help — default fields hint** (#1834) — the addView prompt clarifies that referenced fields must exist on the schema before authoring the view.
- **e2e test consolidation** (#1809 + #1812 + #1813) — three audits trimmed redundant specs, consolidated four redundant cases, split two mega-specs.

### Fixed

- **Delete of imported collections** (#1841) — the `isDataDirSafe` guard rejected `data/collections/<slug>/items` (the normalised dataPath for imports) as "outside the per-collection subtree". Now accepts both `data/<slug>/` (authored) and `data/collections/<slug>/` (imported) as valid per-slug subtrees. Imported collections can finally be deleted through the UI.

### Internal

- **Accounting plugin refactor + page** (#1811 + #1816) — accounting moves to `@mulmoclaude/accounting-plugin` with a dedicated `/accounting` page in the toolbar.
- **Plans archive sweep** (#1810) — 25 shipped plans moved under `plans/done/`.
- **CI: cache puppeteer browsers** (#1749) — speeds up the test job.

### Cascade publishes

- `@mulmoclaude/core` 0.2.7 → 0.2.12

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-25

Three things shape this release: **local voice input** (push-to-talk via on-device `whisper.cpp`, macOS first); a wave of **collection runtime power** (custom views can open records in a host modal *and* start chats with seed prompts referencing a specific record, live view updates over pubsub, field-driven spawn intervals, `manageCollection` schema management); and the **plugin-extraction sweep** that lifts the entire `presentCollection`, `presentHtml`, `presentForm`, `presentDocument` (markdown / marp), `presentChart`, and X-tools surfaces — server core, Vue View / Preview, 8-locale i18n — into standalone npm packages so MulmoTerminal can run them end-to-end with no MulmoClaude code reuse. A separate `packages/services/*` tree carves out headless-backend services on the same logic. Whisper input also lands as a shared `@mulmoclaude/whisper`. Side dishes: 16-connector claude.ai allowlist, a critical MCP handlePermission race fix that could lose the first turn of a fresh session, Windows `claude.exe` spawn, Docker broker path, attachment traversal hardening, vite pinned to 8.0.13 to dodge a dual-runtime e2e crash, CI dev-server pre-warming, Playwright/puppeteer browser caches, and the `mc-zenn` preset skill.

### Added
- **Local voice input — push-to-talk via on-device `whisper.cpp`** (#1773 + #1775) — toggle the mic icon in chat input, hold to talk, release to send. Audio is streamed to a sidecar `whisper.cpp` process bundled with the launcher, so transcription stays on-device (no cloud STT). macOS is the first-class target. Sticky session mic with auto-resume each turn, pause-based segmentation, single-flight guard on mic start, residual-duplicate-sidecar guard, in-memory armed-mic reset on session change. Extracted as the shared `@mulmoclaude/whisper` package (also published at 0.1.2) so MulmoTerminal can reuse the same core; the launcher declares it as a dependency instead of carrying the sidecar code inline. Model validation, graceful shutdown, stale-error handling live in the package.
- **Pre-allowlist 16 additional claude.ai connectors** (#1711) — agent-side pre-allowlist expansion covering the new connectors the user can configure in claude.ai (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Asana, Atlassian, etc.). Removes the per-connector approval friction on first use.
- **Collection custom views can open records in the host modal** (#1748) — a custom view button can now navigate the host into the same record-detail modal the table/calendar uses (instead of being limited to in-iframe rendering). The view dispatches `openItem` and the host pops the modal.
- **Collection custom views can start a draft chat with a seed prompt** (#1752) — a button can dispatch `startChat` with a templated body referencing the record, and the host opens a new draft chat in a chosen role with that seed text. Composable with the open-item view (#1755) — open a record, kick off a chat about *that specific record*.
- **Field-driven spawn interval** (#1738) — collection schema `spawn.every` can now read its interval from a record field (`every.fromField` + `map`), so a single recurrence definition handles "weekly / biweekly / monthly" branching off a record's own dropdown rather than splitting into separate schemas.
- **Live view updates via pubsub** (#1740) — built-in `table` / `calendar` and **custom views** now subscribe to a per-collection pubsub channel, so a record change from any tab / session / agent ticks instantly into the open view. Removes the "edit in chat, switch to view, no update until refresh" surprise.
- **`manageCollection` schema management** (#1734) — extends the MCP tool with `schemaDocs` / `getSchema` / `putSchema` actions so Claude edits collection schemas through a validated surface instead of raw file writes. Wired through `@mulmoclaude/workspace-setup@0.1.2`'s `collection-skills.md` help doc.
- **Collection chat about a specific record** (#1755) — open-item flow has a "chat about this" affordance that drafts a chat seeded with the record's contents, in the role you pick. Pairs with #1752 to close the "I'm in a collection, talk to me about this row" loop.
- **Collection instant-present** (#1785) — when a slash-command chat references a collection, the collection's canvas card now appears **instantly** on the chat draft path (before the agent finishes its first round), not after. Includes a synthetic-seed guard against a fast-agent race when the synth-seed arrives while the agent is still booting.
- **`mc-zenn` preset skill** (#1786) — bundled `mc-*` preset to publish work as a [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/) article (Japanese dev-blog). Discover via the skills launcher. Ships in `@mulmoclaude/workspace-setup@0.1.8`.
- **Headless-backend `packages/services/*` carve-out** (#1733) — services that don't need the Vite frontend (collection-watchers, scheduler, journal, notifier, plugin-host, skill-bridge, whisper, workspace-setup) move to a sibling `packages/services/*` workspace tree with its own `tsconfig.packages.json` entry + CI cache key. Independent versioning, independent publishing, no implicit coupling to the launcher.

### Plugin extraction (NEW shared packages)
- **`@mulmoclaude/form-plugin`** (#1713) — `presentForm` tool's schema + execute logic extracted into a MulmoTerminal-consumable package. MulmoClaude host shrinks to a thin adapter.
- **`@mulmoclaude/markdown-plugin@0.1.0 → 0.1.4`** (#1715 + #1717 + #1719) — `presentDocument` extraction. **0.1.0**: server core. **0.1.2**: shared `renderMarp` + image-fill render core. **0.1.4**: Marp directive slides emit a title-prompt image generation request so the slide isn't left blank when the directive doesn't pre-supply an asset.
- **`@mulmoclaude/x-plugin` + `@mulmoclaude/chart-plugin`** (#1721) — X tools + `presentChart` extraction into shared packages. Both follow the chart-plugin / form-plugin server-then-Vue extraction pattern.
- **`@mulmoclaude/html-plugin@0.1.0 → 0.2.2`** (#1731 + #1732) — NEW shared package for the `presentHtml` tool. **0.1.0**: server-core (schema + save/validate against the generic gui-chat-protocol `files.artifacts` capability). **0.2.0**: Vue View / Preview + `./style.css` move into the package's `./vue` entry, MulmoClaude's `src/plugins/presentHtml/` loses 449 lines, i18n keys move into the package's own 8 locales. **0.2.1 / 0.2.2**: review hardening — `previewUrl ?? htmlArtifactPreviewUrl(filePath)` fallback for the PDF print button, `path`/`html` string validation in `executeHtmlDispatch`, `..` / empty-segment rejection in `htmlArtifactPreviewUrl`.
- **`@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin@0.3.0 → 0.5.2`** (#1723, #1725, #1729, #1730) — extraction sweep. **0.3.0** (#1723 Phase 1 + #1725 Phase 2 first pass): six View components move into the package's `./vue` entry behind `configureCollectionUi()`. **0.4.0** (#1729): extraction COMPLETE — every View component (incl. `CollectionView`, record / config / custom-view modals, `CollectionsIndexView` / `FeedsView` index pages) plus a self-contained vue-i18n instance (all 8 locales) live in the package. **0.4.1**: missing `common.close` key + locale-sync hardening. **0.5.0** (#1730): consumable by a router-less host — refs / file cell links + record modal teleport go through host bindings instead of `<router-link>` / `body` teleport. **0.5.1**: keyboard a11y + `navigate`-absent guard on those host-bound links. **0.5.2**: record ids accept interior dots (new `safeRecordId`) — natural keys like a Slack ts (`1718900000.123456`) or a SemVer (`1.2.3`) are addressable via `manageCollection` (#1735); `..`, path separators, leading / trailing dots stay rejected.
- **`@mulmoclaude/collection-watchers@0.1.1`** — `trigger date unparseable` now warns only for a present-but-malformed value; absent/empty optional trigger date is silent instead of logging a WARN every reconcile tick.
- **`@mulmoclaude/workspace-setup@0.1.2 → 0.1.8`** — bundles the new `mc-zenn` preset; `collection-skills.md` help doc steers schema edits through `manageCollection` `schemaDocs` / `getSchema` / `putSchema` instead of raw file edits, and documents the record-id charset rule referencing `safeRecordId` as the single source of truth.

### Changed
- **`mulmocast 2.6.22`** — diagnostic-error sweep from receptron/mulmocast-cli #1452-#1457 + #1459 picks up. TTS Gemini no longer masks ffmpeg SIGABRT as `"TTS Gemini Error"`; Whisper CLI splits ffmpeg / OpenAI / fs into 3 phases; Replicate image / lipsync / movie + OpenAI image + TTS ElevenLabs agents now interpolate `error.message` into catch-all throws so the underlying provider message reaches mulmoclaude server logs instead of a generic opaque label (the original `error="TTS Gemini Error"` report at mulmocast-cli #1451 motivated this).
- **e2e dev-server pre-warming** — Playwright's `globalSetup` now warms the Vite dev server before any test starts so the first `page.goto` doesn't pay the on-demand compile penalty and the e2e `(1)` / `(2)` shards stop occasionally timing out on the first navigation.
- **`tsconfig.json` `types: ["vite/client", "node"]`** — adds `"node"` so `vue-tsc` resolves the `node:*` imports in `src/lib/wiki-page/*` (Node-only files that happen to live under `src/`). Unblocks the lint_test typecheck step on lockfile-only PRs.
- **gui-chat-plugin minor bumps** (#1780 / #1781 / #1782) — `@gui-chat-plugin/browse@0.5.0`, `@gui-chat-plugin/google-map@0.6.0`, and friends; included via the rolling dep-update PRs.
- **`puppeteer-core@25.2.1`** (#1783), **`undici@7.28.0`** (#1753), dependabot bumps for `hono@4.12.25` (#1716), `nodemailer@9.0.1` (#1726), `dompurify@3.4.11` (#1727), and other routine refreshes (#1714 / #1736 / #1741 / #1778 / #1787).
- **CI bump guard** (#1737 + #1788) — a CI guard script blocks PRs that change a shared package's `src/` but forget to bump its `version`. #1788 exempts non-shipping `package.json` diffs from the guard so doc-only or comment-only `package.json` changes don't require a version bump.

### Fixed
- **MCP `handlePermission` race could lose the first turn of a fresh session** (#1712 / #1698) — `handlePermission` is now served immediately so session start can't race MCP load. The fresh-session failure mode was: send a message before MCP finished registering tools → the first tool call returned a permission error and the session sat stuck.
- **Windows `claude.exe` spawn** (#1769 / #1757) — cross-platform `claude` CLI resolver via a typed `ClaudeCliNotFoundError`, Windows shell for the spawn probes, `try/catch` around `spawnClaude` to surface the real error, and pnpm global probing made version-agnostic.
- **MCP broker path in Docker** (#1771 / #1770) — broker source path resolves relative to `config.ts` and the same fix applies under Docker bind mounts too.
- **Attachment companion-file traversal** (#1756 + #1760 + #1762 + #1765) — path validator factory + `..` strictness restoration so attachment companion files can't escape their parent dir, with a consolidated `hasTraversalSegment()` shared across the host. Closes a class of issues opened during the chat-input multi-attach work in 0.8.0.
- **Vite pinned to exactly 8.0.13** (#1750) — newer vite 8.x breaks the e2e suite with a dual-runtime crash (`vue-i18n` / `runtime-dom` resolved through two paths). Pinning to 8.0.13 + refreshing committed dispatcher artifacts (#1746) unbreaks main CI.
- **Marp image-fill regression** (#1719) — Marp directive slides without a pre-supplied image left the slide blank instead of emitting a title-prompt image generation request. Markdown-plugin 0.1.4 restores generation.
- **`renderMarpDeck` PDF dimensions test gap** (#1718) — explicit test coverage for the PDF sizing path; drops dead `extractSlideDimensions` along the way.
- **Vue pin dispatcher artifact refresh** (#1746) — main CI was broken because committed dispatcher bundles were stale relative to the vue 3.5.34 resolution; regenerated and committed.
- **`fix-vite-workspace-path`** (#1570) — dev token plugin honours `MULMOCLAUDE_WORKSPACE_PATH` instead of assuming `$HOME/mulmoclaude`.

### Infrastructure
- **Cache Playwright browsers in the e2e job** (#1728) and **cache puppeteer browsers in the test jobs** (#1749) — drops the per-job 60-90s Chrome download to a sub-second cache hit. Also de-flakes against the puppeteer CDN's occasional `End-of-central-directory signature not found` ZIP corruption.
- **Collection View move + UI-context plumbing** (#1729 / #1725) — the host injects collection-aware navigation, modal teleport target, recordHref, and i18n through a single `configureCollectionUi()` binding instead of N separate props. Same pattern the chart/form plugins already use.

### Docs
- **`collections-vibe-crafting-help.md`** (#1758) — new help doc on the iterative "vibe-craft a collection from a sample" workflow. Surfaces collections + custom views as the headline feature.

### Refactor
- **frontend `toError` helper** (#1766) — single helper for `unknown → Error` narrowing on the frontend.
- **`errorMessage` codemod sweep** (#1767) — replaces the inlined `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` pattern across 12 sites with the shared `errorMessage(err)` helper. No behaviour change.
- **Consolidate `hasTraversalSegment()`** (#1760) and **`makePathValidator()` factory** (#1762) — both feed the attachment traversal fix above.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-16

Collections graduate from "spreadsheets with bells" into a real DSL platform. The headline change is **custom views** — LLM-authored HTML pages that render alongside the built-in table/calendar, sandboxed in an iframe with the collection's records JSON injected for live filtering, charting, dashboards, even podcast players. A companion **`manageCollection` MCP tool** gives Claude the same affordances the host has — computed-aware reads + schema-validated writes — replacing the previous "Claude writes JSON files directly via Write" pattern. **`spawnBackgroundChat`** lands as a generic parallel-chat primitive that underpins collection-level actions and broader fan-out workflows. Side dishes: per-column sort with localStorage persistence, multi-file attach in the chat input (up to 10), expandable notification bodies, and a fistful of UI / scheduler / CSP fixes.

### Added
- **Custom views for collections** — drop an `views/<slug>.html` (or `.html.tmpl`) under a collection's data folder and a new view picker appears next to table/calendar. The page renders inside a sandbox iframe with the records JSON injected, so vanilla JS / CSS / chart libraries / `<audio>` / `<video>` all work end to end. A view config modal in the CollectionView header lets users reorder, rename, and delete views without leaving the canvas. The (rarely-used) built-in dashboard view is replaced by "author one as a custom view". (#1686, #1687)
- **`manageCollection` MCP tool** — LLM-callable read/write API symmetric to CollectionView. Reads include computed / derived fields; writes go through the same schema validator the UI uses, so a bad record is rejected at call time rather than silently corrupting the data folder. Becomes the canonical way for LLMs to mutate collection records. (#1681)
- **`spawnBackgroundChat` agent primitive** — any tool can now spawn a sibling chat in a different role with a templated seed prompt and get a handle back for status polling. Foundation for the new collection-level actions and broader fan-out workflows (e.g. an invoice action spawning a parallel payment-recording chat). (#1678)
- **Tracked-lessons collection recipe + collection-level actions** — second canonical collection recipe (after invoicing). Demonstrates a *collection-level* action button (vs. the existing per-record kind), the `presentHtml` action target, and the schema-validated write contract end to end. (#1669)
- **Per-column sort in CollectionView's table** — clickable column header cycles ascending → descending → off; the choice persists per (workspace × collection) in localStorage so revisits restore the same order. (#1674, #1677)
- **Multi-file attach in chat input** — paste / drop / file-picker up to 10 attachments per turn (was 1). Each attachment renders in the composer with its own remove button; the send-enabled rule treats text *or* any attachment as a valid send. (#1660)
- **Notification body expansion** — clicking a bell entry now expands its full body (markdown / record snapshot) inline. Faster triage for the daily news brief and collection completion bells. (#1619)

### Changed
- **Dashboard view mode removed** — the fixed, enum-driven dashboard rarely earned its keep; anyone who wants one can now author a custom view tuned to their schema. A persisted `dashboard` value in localStorage falls through to `table` via the existing unknown-mode safety net. All dashboard i18n keys are dropped from the 8 locales. (#1687)
- **CollectionView header shorter** — shaves ~24px off the chrome so on small canvas cards the table body gets more rows visible above the fold without scrolling. (#1689)
- **`MarpSplitEditor` extracted as a shared component** — the marp split-pane editor moves into a reusable component so other markdown surfaces can adopt the same chrome. (#1665)

### Fixed
- **Scheduler state persistence race** — replaced the static `scheduler.tmp` write path with a unique-tmp helper so two scheduler ticks landing in the same millisecond can no longer trample each other's writes (one would publish a half-written JSON). (#1693)
- **CSP blocked audio/video in custom views** — the custom-view CSP omitted `media-src`, so a podcast-feed custom view's `<audio src="https://...mp3">` fell through to `default-src 'none'` and the browser refused to load. Added a `media-src` with the same `https:` + `data:` + `blob:` allowlist as the existing iframe CSP. (#1688)

### Docs / Research
- **"DSLs as Harnesses"** arXiv pre-print — theoretical scaffolding for the collections-as-DSL bet: a DSL can serve as a harness that constrains, validates, and structures an agent's reasoning. CC BY 4.0 + a revision after external review. (#1691, #1692, #1694)
- **"The Workspace Is the Self-Improving Agent"** arXiv pre-print — companion paper framing the workspace + collection corpus as the substrate for "owning the learning loop", from single user up to firm scale. (#1683, #1695, #1696)
- **"Software for an Audience of One"** essay — refines the collections-and-custom-views thesis: applications are data, the schema is the harness, Claude is the runtime. (#1690)
- **Terminal-native chat plan** — design doc for eliminating `claude -p` in favour of a terminal-native chat surface, with permissions also moving terminal-native. (#1697, #1699)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-10

Three large built-ins move out of the launcher in favour of the schema-driven collections model: **Calendar**, the **Todo plugin**, and the **Encore** recurring-obligation built-in are all removed; their use cases are now expressed as collections (`calendarField` for dated items, `config/helps/todo-collection.md` for todo lists, `triggerField` + `spawn` for recurring obligations). The bundled **invoicing suite** moves the same way — from preset skills to on-demand help-file recipes. No data is deleted; the records on disk are left in place.

### Changed
- The **invoicing suite** (`clients`, `worklog`, `invoice`, `profile`) moved from bundled `mc-*` preset skills to on-demand **help-file recipes** (`config/helps/billing-clients-worklog.md` + `config/helps/billing-invoice.md`), discoverable via two Personal-role sample prompts ("Set up client and time tracking…", "Set up invoicing…"). New workspaces no longer carry the four presets in the skill catalog; the recipes scaffold bare-slug collections (`/collections/invoice`, etc.) over the same prefix-free `data/*/items` record folders. On launch, any lingering starred `mc-{clients,worklog,invoice,profile}` skill is **removed** from `.claude/skills/` (records under `data/*/items` are left untouched), and a one-time bell explains the change — re-running a recipe re-attaches to the same data, so existing records reappear. No data is ever deleted.

### Removed
- The standalone **Calendar view** and the **`manageCalendar`** tool have been removed. Dated items are now modelled as schema-driven collections with a `calendarField` (the collection-native calendar view) — see `config/helps/collection-skills.md`. The `/calendar` launcher button, the `/calendar` route (now redirects to `/automations`), and the `data/scheduler/items.json` file-preview special case are gone. **Automations is unaffected** — `manageAutomations`, the `/automations` view, the `/api/scheduler` routes, and the task-manager all keep working (automations now owns the shared scheduler API namespace). Existing `data/scheduler/items.json` is left in place on disk.
- The **Todo plugin** (`@mulmoclaude/todo-plugin`, the `manageTodoList` tool, the `/todos` route, and the `TodoExplorer` kanban / table / list view) has been removed. Todo lists are now built as schema-driven collections via the `config/helps/todo-collection.md` recipe (status enum + `done` toggle + priority bells), which is the canonical replacement. Existing todo-plugin data (`data/plugins/%40mulmoclaude%2Ftodo-plugin/todos.json`) is left in place on disk and is **not** migrated automatically — re-author the list as a collection following the recipe.
- The **Encore** built-in (recurring-obligation DSL, hourly tick, dashboard, `defineEncore` / `manageEncore` tools, `/encore` route) has been removed. Collections now covers recurring obligations via time-driven bells (`triggerField` / `triggerLeadDays`) and host-driven recurrence (`spawn`); the only Encore-unique capability left was graduated multi-phase severity escalation, which did not justify maintaining a second time-driven harness.

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-05-26

Fixes a production regression where `npx mulmoclaude@latest` failed to load the ToDo and Spotify runtime plugins (e.g. "ToDo の読み込みに失敗しました" on first launch) because the published tarball did not ship them. They now travel with `mulmoclaude` as regular npm dependencies, so a fresh `npx` install boots with ToDo and Spotify available out of the box. Other runtime plugins (`debug`, `edgar`) stay dev-only by design and no longer log misleading `preset package not resolvable` warns in production.

### Fixed
- `npx mulmoclaude` no longer fails to mount ToDo / Spotify on first launch — `@mulmoclaude/todo-plugin@^0.1.0` and `@mulmoclaude/spotify-plugin@^0.1.0` are now real npm dependencies of `mulmoclaude` (#1513, #1515).
- Preset loader downgrades the missing-package log to `debug` for entries flagged `devOnly: true`, so legitimately dev-only presets stop scaring production users (#1513).

### Added
- Two new published npm packages backing the runtime plugins:
  - [`@mulmoclaude/todo-plugin@0.1.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mulmoclaude/todo-plugin/v/0.1.0)
  - [`@mulmoclaude/spotify-plugin@0.1.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mulmoclaude/spotify-plugin/v/0.1.0)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-05-20

Four-day patch focused on a new **Encore** built-in (cycle-state planning + bell-reconciled todos), a **CodeMirror-based inline JSON editor** for workspace configs, **Docker-aware MCP catalog with stdio→HTTP shim** (so stdio-only MCP servers run inside the sandbox), and a **role split** that pulls personal-assistant workflows out of `General` into a dedicated `Personal` role. Plus the system-prompt build path was rearchitected (literals out to files, helps-injection deleted, topic-memory context index-only) and a handful of UI polish wins (srcset rewriter, app version in Settings, notification-history collapse, TODO kanban done-column menu).

### Highlights

#### Encore — cycle-state planning + bell-reconciled todos
- New **`/encore` dashboard page** with an icon-only top-bar entry, backed by an Encore built-in plugin (#1427, #1443).
- Split **structural `defineEncore`** (one-shot schema definition) from **operational `manageEncore`** (ongoing ticket ops) so the LLM can't confuse the two (#1437).
- Single-reconciler bell-state model with **unsnooze**, timezone-correct triggers, directory hygiene, ticket-rename support, and ghost-ticket rescue (#1433, #1440, #1441).

#### CodeMirror-based inline JSON editor (#833 Phase 1)
- Workspace JSON configs now open in an in-page editor (Files view, #1418).
- Lazy-loaded CodeMirror 6 backend with syntax-aware editing replaces the textarea (#1450, #1448).

#### MCP catalog becomes transport-aware (#1421)
- Docker-only stdio MCPs get a clear **"this won't run inside the sandbox"** note in the catalog; GitHub MCP now points at the HTTP transport (#1422).
- Opt-in **stdio→HTTP shim** lets stdio-only MCP servers run inside the Docker sandbox via a side-process bridge — covers the previous gap (#1436).

#### Role split — General + Personal (#1430)
- `General` is split into a lean `General` (research / coding) and a new **`Personal`** role (memory, journal, calendar, TODO, photos). Encore's seed role is pinned to Personal.
- Roles now rely directly on the per-role prompt files; the old `helps`-injection layer is deleted (#1431).

#### Wiki / image / UI polish
- `<img>` / `<source>` **`srcset` rewriter** in both wiki and PDF surfaces (#1407, closes #1275).
- Wiki external/workspace markdown links restyled for clarity (#1453).
- TODO kanban **done-column menu** with check icon and click-outside dismiss (#1452); plugin-seeded first turns render as a **skill-style card** (#1447).
- Settings modal shows the **app version** (#1412, closes #1410).
- NotificationBell **collapses history beyond 5 rows** behind a toggle (#1439); notifier gains an **update op + action-style priority alerts** for todos (#1451).

#### Skill catalog UX
- Add-repo flow now offers **fill-form suggestions**, repo link, and expandable description for each preset (#1415, closes #1413).

### Added
- **Encore** built-in: dashboard page, `defineEncore` / `manageEncore` tools, unified bell reconciler with unsnooze (#1427, #1437, #1433, #1443).
- CodeMirror 6 JSON editor for workspace files (#1418, #1450).
- MCP transport-aware catalog + stdio→HTTP shim (#1421 / #1422 / #1436).
- New `Personal` role split off from `General` (#1430).
- Skill add-repo suggestions UX (#1415, closes #1413).
- `srcset` rewriting on `<img>` / `<source>` for wiki + PDF (#1407, closes #1275).
- App version surfaced in Settings (#1412).
- NotificationBell history collapse + notifier update op / priority alerts (#1439, #1451).
- TODO kanban done-column menu polish (#1452).
- Plugin-seeded text-response renders as a skill-style card (#1447).

### Changed
- System prompt internals refactored: static literals extracted to `server/prompts/`, `helps`-injection deleted, topic-memory context is index-only, dead readLegacyMemoryFile / buildWikiContext branches removed (#1425, #1431, #1434, #1435).
- Wiki external-link styling distinguishes workspace vs external (#1453).
- `Skill` tool added to the agent allowlist so user-installed `.claude/skills/` are invokable (#1445).
- Built hook dispatcher relocated to `server/build/`, sourcemap dropped (#1449).

### Fixed
- `optionalDeps` notification title/body wording (#1429).
- e2e-live `L-ERR` / `L-15b` flakiness on real-Claude runs (#1446).
- `publish smoke` Puppeteer Chromium download + plugin-probe race (#1442, #1428).
- Encore review P0s + form-schema validation LLM-trap (#1441).
- Skill `flex-1` restored after StackView selector was scoped (#1408, follow-up to #1277).
- Playwright browsers auto-installed via the test script chain (#1411).

### Security
- Opt-in stdio→HTTP shim (#1436) lets stdio MCP servers run inside the Docker sandbox via a bridged HTTP transport, closing a gap where catalog entries were silently host-only.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-05-16

Three-day patch centred on the **external skill catalog** (a multi-PR `#1383` / `#1335` track), an **MCP reliability trio**, and **graceful degradation when optional host tools are missing**. Skills are now browsable / star-able / preview-able from a hierarchical catalog that can pull from external Git repos. MCP servers get boot-time preflight, a runtime failure monitor, and catalog-derived error hints. Missing `ffmpeg` / `docker` no longer crash startup — the app degrades and tells you which features are off.

### Highlights

#### External skill catalog (#1383 / #1335)
- Skills are split into **catalog** (browsable, not in the system prompt) vs **active** (loaded). Star to activate; Preview and Run-once before committing.
- Catalog can pull skills from **external Git repos** (backend C1, hierarchical UI C2, per-repo Update button C3). Recommended presets seeded, including `obra/superpowers`.
- `/skills` legend now shows inline category icons; nested preset scanning.

#### MCP reliability trio
- **Boot-time preflight (#1352)** — catalog-backed MCP servers with missing required config are skipped with a warning instead of spawning a subprocess that fails every call silently.
- **Runtime failure monitor (#1353)** — a server that fails repeatedly raises a bell notification.
- **Error hint chip (#1354)** — MCP tool errors in the right sidebar carry a catalog-derived "how to fix" hint.

#### Graceful degradation for optional host dependencies (#1385)
- Missing `ffmpeg` / `docker` / other optional host tools degrade gracefully (clear notification + affected-feature list) instead of hard-exiting at startup.
- New `--disable-sandbox` flag plus bundled boolean CLI flags (#1089 / #1397).

#### Multi-day calendar events (#1368)
- Calendar now renders events that span multiple days.

#### Role-aware empty state
- A fresh chat shows clickable starter queries tailored to the active role.

#### Investor role gains X (Twitter) access
- `searchX` / `readXPost` added to the Investor role.

### Added
- External skill catalog: catalog/active split, Star, Preview, Run-once, external Git repo install + update (#1383, #1335).
- MCP boot preflight (#1352), runtime failure monitor (#1353), error-hint chip (#1354).
- Optional-dependency graceful degradation + `--disable-sandbox` / bundled boolean CLI flags (#1385, #1089, #1397).
- Multi-day calendar events (#1368).
- Role-aware empty state with clickable starter queries.
- `searchX` / `readXPost` for the Investor role.
- `liveIsRunning` session predicate (#1195).
- Scheduled Claude-free e2e-live workflow (daily 03:00 JST) + expanded fake-echo scenario coverage.

### Changed
- Dropped `?result=` URL persistence — sessions default to the latest result on load.
- `helps` model names aligned with the `presentMulmoScript` canonical structure (#1009).
- `auth-token` persistence across server restarts documented (#1351); ffmpeg prerequisite documented.

### Fixed
- `presentMulmoScript`: silent beats now advance by duration during Play (#1073); inline error chip + retry on movie-generation failure (#1197).
- `StackView`: `flex-1` neutralisation scoped to vertical flex only (#1277).
- CodeRabbit sweep follow-up — starter-query key collision, magic-number / hardcoded-path cleanup, and a pre-existing `@types/which` typecheck break on `main` (#1379 / #1364 / #1371).

### Security
- MCP boot preflight (#1352) stops half-configured catalog servers from spawning subprocesses that would otherwise fail every tool call silently (401 / missing-credentials), reducing the chance of a misconfigured server being mistaken for a working one.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-13

Three-day patch focused on **Settings UX**, **agent control surface**, and **bridge security hardening**. The Settings modal is now a grouped sidebar (4 categories) and exposes a new **Model** tab for tuning Claude's reasoning effort. New built-in plugins (`presentSVG`, `edgar`) and an **Investor** role land alongside a re-shaped preset-skill system (`mc-settings`, `mc-cooking-coach`). All 6 webhook bridges grow rate limiting + trust-proxy hardening, and several reflected-XSS paths are closed.

### Highlights

#### Configurable reasoning effort (#1320 / #1323)
- New **Model** tab in Settings exposes the `claude --effort` level (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`). Persisted under `<workspace>/config/settings.json`; unset → Claude's default. Settings reload per-run, so the change applies on the next message without restart.

#### Settings menu reorganised (#1333)
- The horizontal tab strip is now a **grouped left sidebar** (LLM / Servers / Workspace / Plugins). Modal grows from 36rem to 52rem but caps at 95vw on smaller viewports. Existing `data-testid` selectors preserved — no e2e breakage. Active item carries `aria-current="page"`; nav label is fully translated.

#### File drop on the chat panel (#1289)
- Drag-and-drop now lights up the entire chat panel (was: just the input), with a clear visual affordance. The window default guard prevents the browser from navigating away when the drop lands outside the panel.

#### EDGAR + SEC built-in plugin
- New `edgar` plugin (server-only — no Views) gives the agent direct access to SEC EDGAR filings. Bundled into a new **Investor** role alongside Yahoo Finance instructions.

#### presentSVG plugin
- New built-in plugin renders generated SVGs as inline canvas surfaces. Roles can opt in via `availablePlugins`.

#### Preset skills replace fixed roles
- `cookingCoach` role → `mc-cooking-coach` preset skill (#1286). `settings` role → `mc-settings` preset skill (#1283), then split into 3 focused skills. Preset skills are user-editable and version-controllable; fixed roles aren't.

#### Agent permission scaffolding
- Workspace-scoped allow rules are now provisioned at server startup, so first-run permission prompts no longer block routine tool invocations.

### Added
- `effortLevel` field in app settings + `--effort` CLI plumbing (#1323).
- Settings **Model** + **Sidebar** UI; nav `aria-label` localised across all 8 locales.
- `presentSVG` and `edgar` built-in plugins.
- `Investor` role with EDGAR + Yahoo Finance instructions.
- Preset skills: `mc-settings` (3 focused subskills) and `mc-cooking-coach`.
- Workspace-scoped agent permission provisioning at startup.
- File-drop visual affordance + chat-panel-wide drop target (#1289 Step 1 + Step 2).
- `docs/shared-utils.md` catalog + CLAUDE.md guardrail (#1304).
- Stdio-MCP-under-Docker warning surfaced in the MCP settings UI (#1334).

### Changed
- Settings modal: top tabs → sidebar with 4 groups (#1333).
- Accounting amount formatting consolidated into one helper (#1308).
- Date formatting in plugin Views routed through `src/utils/format/date.ts` (#1307).
- `truncate()` callsites consolidated into `server/utils/text.ts` (#1306).
- Inline error normalisation migrated to `errorMessage()` helper (#1305).
- New shared `formatBytes()` helper (#1309).
- Wiki bullet `[[slug|display]]` rows now share the same parser as inline wiki links.
- DOM-pure wiki-page helpers relocated under `src/lib/wiki-page/` (#1297).
- `uuid` bumped to 14.0.0.

### Fixed
- pdf.ts: switched to `waitUntil: "load"` for Puppeteer 24 type compatibility.
- wiki: score-based fuzzy resolve replaces iteration-order matching (#1194).
- chat: generated-file references in LLM replies now linkify reliably (#1300).
- pdf responses: skip Content-Security-Policy header (#1299).
- chatinput: drop overlay clears on window-boundary `dragleave` (#1327 follow-up).
- Docker sandbox: stdio MCP entries are dropped (they can't run inside the minimal image — #1334).
- runtime-plugin: HEAD probes on plugin assets bypass bearer auth.
- hooks: atomic mirror write + API_ROUTES constant in tests.
- Codex/Sourcery follow-ups across #1316, #1318, #1325, #1326, #1328, #1331.

### Security
- All 6 webhook bridges: express-rate-limit added on POST + `env`-driven trust-proxy.
- Bridges: `hub.challenge` echoed as `text/plain` with whitelisted shape (CodeQL `js/reflected-xss`).
- wiki: HTML-escape target + display in `renderWikiLinks` (XSS).
- `keyGenerator` routed through `ipKeyGenerator` for IPv6-safe rate-limit keys.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-10

Two-day patch with several visible additions: a **wiki-syntax embed** family (`[[amazon:...]]`, `[[isbn:...]]`, `[[youtube:...]]`) usable across every markdown surface, **photo location capture** that pulls lat/lng from EXIF on every saved/forwarded image, and the **Map plugin** wired up to `@gui-chat-plugin/google-map`. Notifications fired by the `notify` MCP tool inside a chat now carry a click target back to the source session.

### Highlights

#### Wiki-syntax embeds (#1221)
- Author markdown can now write `[[amazon:B00ICN066A]]`, `[[isbn:9780062316097]]`, or `[[youtube:dQw4w9WgXcQ]]` instead of raw URLs and get a clickable card / link / inline player. The renderer is registry-driven so future prefixes plug in cleanly.
- **YouTube** plays inline via `youtube-nocookie.com` (no profile cookies until click), wrapped in a 16:9 box. **Amazon** shows the product cover thumbnail and links to the user's locale-appropriate storefront (`amazon.co.jp` for `ja`, `amazon.de` for `de`, …, falls back to `.com`). **ISBN** links to OpenLibrary.
- External markdown links across wiki / files / chat artifact / sources / skill body now open in a new tab on click instead of being dead-clicks.

#### Photo locations (#1222)
- Every photo MulmoClaude saves (chat attachments, bridge-forwarded images, file uploads) now has its EXIF parsed: lat/lng + timestamp + camera + lens captured into a sidecar JSON under `data/photo-locations/`. HEIC / HEIF / TIFF supported alongside JPEG.
- New built-in `managePhotoLocations` plugin lets the agent and user list / search / open photos by date, place, or camera.
- Photos tab in Settings exposes the auto-capture toggle.
- LINE bridge now forwards inbound image messages to the agent for the same processing.

#### Map plugin (#1227)
- Integrated `@gui-chat-plugin/google-map@0.4.0`. Add a Google Maps API key under Settings → Map and the agent can show locations, add markers, find places, and request directions inline in the chat canvas.
- Available in `general` / `guide` / `debug` roles.

#### Notifications open the source chat (#1262)
- When the `notify` MCP tool fires from inside a chat session (typically a scheduled background chat reporting completion), the bell entry now carries a navigate target. Clicking opens that chat session instead of just dismissing.

### Added
- `[[amazon:...]]` / `[[isbn:...]]` / `[[youtube:...]]` wiki-embed renderers + extension registry (#1252 / #1261 / #1265 / #1269).
- `managePhotoLocations` built-in plugin + Photos settings tab (#1247 / #1250 / #1251).
- Map plugin wiring + Settings → Map tab + role enablement (#1241 / #1255 / `4c5b3e1`).
- LINE bridge: inbound photo forwarding (#1264, `b3aab94`).
- `notify` MCP tool: chat-session linkback via `navigateTarget` (#1262).
- Plan files for #1221, #1222, #1244, and Encore Phase 2 (DSL + compiler + runtime architecture).

### Changed
- Runtime plugins relocated from `packages/<name>-plugin/` to `packages/plugins/<name>-plugin/` for a cleaner monorepo layout (#1242). No npm package names change.
- `marked` config: external links inject `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` automatically — wired into all 6 markdown / sheet renderers (#1252).
- Roles now gate runtime plugins by `availablePlugins` (#1266); previously runtime plugins were universally exposed regardless of role.
- DOMPurify call sites for skill body / manageSkills / sources description now go through a shared `sanitizeMarkdownHtml` wrapper that selectively allows YouTube embeds while keeping every other iframe stripped.

### Fixed
- StackView no longer over-grows iframes on remeasure or in stack layout — postMessage height path now caps at the viewport (`a2017c4` / `0ae82df` / `5817790` / `4aa6461`).
- Map plugin: `googleMapKey` flows through StackView; View force-remounts when the key transitions null → set; key gated to `mapControl` only so other plugins can't read it (`f45067c` / `894ef3c` / `79a7cbf` / `1b04a34`).
- presentMulmoScript: beat edits now persist across page reload + in-SPA nav (#1074, `adcca77` / `7dc74b0`).
- Workspace links: percent-encoded image self-repair + multibyte URL routing fixed (#1102, `b8899fb` / `c8b14e0`).
- Photo EXIF: lat/lng rescue path covers more vendor variants; HEIC/HEIF/TIFF registered for capture (#1222, `8c9aea7`).
- mulmoclaude launcher deps: `@gui-chat-plugin/google-map` and `exifr` declared so the published tarball boots (`c798a20` / `5e17513`).
- CI cache path now includes `packages/plugins/*/dist` after the workspace move (`830a5145`).

### Security
- DOMPurify wrapper enforces a strict allowlist for iframes — only `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/<11-char-id>` survives the hook; foreign hosts and the cookie-tracking `youtube.com` host are stripped.
- Map plugin: `googleMapKey` only reaches the `mapControl` plugin; other plugins receive `null` (`1b04a34`).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-08

A two-week release. The themes: a usable **Accounting plugin**, the start of the **personal-use plugin sets** (recipe-book, reading-list / articles / quotes, map), a **Memory system** with proactive recall and edit UI, the **Notifier (Encore) prototype**, the **Spotify plugin**, **MulmoScript** quality-of-life polish, and a swarm of dev-experience wins.

### Highlights

- **Accounting plugin** — bookkeeping with batch journal entry, invoice-system T-number handling, BS/PL shortcuts, time-series view, account naming with codes, dedicated Accounting role.
- **Memory system** — proactive recall during turns + in-app edit UI for memory entries.
- **Personal-use plugin sets begin shipping** — recipe-book (Cooking Coach PR-A), reading-list / articles / quotes (My Library PR-A/B/C), map plugin scaffold. Roadmap in #1169.
- **Skill body collapsed in canvas** (#1220) — invoking a skill shows a card (name + description), expandable to the full markdown body. No more wall-of-text in the canvas.
- **Spotify plugin** — OAuth + listening data + search + player controls.
- **Notifier (Encore) prototype** — early cross-channel notification surface.
- **MulmoScript polish** — lightbox toolbar (#918), background-movie load (#888 / #889), General role can author MulmoScripts (#887).
- **MCP catalog expansion** — Spotify, YouTube, GitHub, Linear, Google OAuth presets out of the box (#867 / #868 / #869 / #872 / #873).

### Added

- **Wiki edits show inline in chat** (#989) — when the LLM `Write`s/`Edit`s a `data/wiki/pages/*.md`, the canvas renders the page automatically from the snapshot taken at that exact moment.
- **Wiki page history UI** (#917 / #946) — browse a page's edit history and roll back.
- **`presentHtml` becomes editable** (#988 / #1001 / #982) — the agent can iteratively edit a generated HTML doc instead of regenerating from scratch.
- **Copy chat as Markdown** (#1065) — one-click copy of the whole conversation.
- **Skills tab in suggestions** (#886) — invoke saved skills from the suggestions panel.
- **Today's journal shortcut** (#879) — sidebar shortcut to today's journal entry.
- **Session bookmark + delete** (#953) — pin or remove sessions from the sidebar.
- **Bridge skill shortcut** (#967) — bridge messages starting with `/<slash>` route to the matching saved skill, so phone-side users can invoke skills with one keystroke.
- **`tool_result` payloads carry an `artifactPath`** field (#983) — cards link directly to the underlying file.
- **Image rendering unified across PDF, presentHtml, and the chat canvas** (#969 / #972 / #974) — workspace-relative `![]()` references resolve consistently everywhere.
- **Translation service** for role queries (#1172 / #1173).
- **`/debug` page** (#1192) and dev-mode debug role (#1186), gated on `VITE_DEV_MODE=1`.
- **`create-mulmoclaude-plugin` CLI** (#1163) — scaffolder for new runtime plugins.
- **Preset skills** shipped with the launcher (#1211).
- **Plugin error boundary** (#1147) — when a plugin crashes, the canvas shows a fallback card instead of breaking the whole pane.
- **Tool-call history persists across reloads** (#1101) — the right-sidebar history pane reconstructs from the session JSONL.

### Changed

- **`manageWiki` MCP tool removed** — wiki edits auto-render via Write/Edit. Browse / lint flows direct the user at the `/wiki` UI. View-only `PluginEntry` retained so historical sessions still render their `manageWiki` cards (#989).
- **Todo plugin migrated to `packages/todo-plugin/`** runtime-plugin shape; existing `~/mulmoclaude/data/todos/{todos,columns}.json` auto-migrates on first launch (#1149).
- **`yarn dev` skip-if-fresh package build** (#1208) — cold-restart 8.5s → 0.04s when source is unchanged.
- **`yarn package`** one-liner builds a publishable `mulmoclaude-X.Y.Z.tgz` with stale-tarball cleanup (#1230).
- **MCP server presets** — Spotify / YouTube / GitHub / Linear / Google OAuth available without manual registration (#867 / #868 / #869 / #872 / #873).
- **Atomic writes v2** (#885 / #890) — workspace files (wiki pages, journal, todos, …) write via tmp-and-rename so a kill -9 mid-save can't leave a half-written file.
- **`gui-chat-protocol` bumped to 0.3.0** (#1123) → 0.3.2 mid-cycle (typed runtime endpoints).
- **`zod` v4** for built-in plugins (#1204).

### Fixed

- **Sandbox mode silently disabled in published npm package** — `Dockerfile.sandbox` and `sandbox-entrypoint.sh` are now bundled (carried over from 0.5.3 with extra tarball asserts).
- **`presentHtml` iframe height** (#1228) — long HTML docs scroll naturally instead of clipping at the pane bottom.
- **`presentHtml` Safari CSP** (#991) — Safari's inline bootstrap scripts no longer blocked.
- **`/files` HTML preview relative paths** (#980), **`artifacts/html` sibling images resolve** (#981).
- **Wiki page-edit publish failure no longer 500s** the snapshot route — the snapshot is already on disk; a publish error logs a warning instead of failing the response.
- **Notifier validation + emit safety** (#1199 / #1223).
- **Chat attachment leak** (#1069) — attachment uploads no longer carry over between chats.

### Security

- **Strict data gating** for plugin scope roots (#1181) — plugins can only read/write inside their scoped data directory; lexical traversal checks prevent `..` escapes.

### Breaking Changes

- **`manageWiki` MCP tool definition removed** (#989). Custom roles listing it still load (lenient zod parse silently drops the name) but the LLM can no longer call it. Agents that needed `manageWiki action='page'` to display a page in the canvas no longer need that call — wiki Writes/Edits auto-render.
- **Built-in todo plugin moved to `packages/todo-plugin/`** (#1149). Existing data auto-migrates on first launch. Custom code importing from `src/plugins/todo/` will fail to resolve — switch to `@mulmoclaude/todo-plugin/{shared,composables,vue}`.

### Packages published during this cycle

- `@mulmobridge/client@0.1.5` (#994), `@mulmobridge/chat-service@0.1.3` (#993).

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Sandbox mode silently disabled in published npm package** — `Dockerfile.sandbox` and `sandbox-entrypoint.sh` were not bundled into the `mulmoclaude` tarball, so on `npx mulmoclaude` the server logged `Failed to set up sandbox, running unrestricted` and fell back to unrestricted execution. Both files are now copied by `prepare-dist.js` and listed in `files`, and `scripts/mulmoclaude/tarball.mjs` asserts their presence in the packed tarball to prevent regressions.
- **`mulmoclaude --version` printed stale `0.5.1`** — the launcher had a hard-coded version string that drifted from `package.json` after 0.5.2. Now matches the published version.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Image rendering in HTML / PDF** — LLM-generated content emitting `<img src="/artifacts/images/…">` (web-rooted convention) now renders correctly. The path-traversal hardening from #384 was correct but didn't recognise the leading-slash form, so:
  - PDF generation logged `image path escapes workspace` and produced a broken `<img>`.
  - presentHtml plugin's iframe srcdoc 404'd the image because `/artifacts/` isn't served at the SPA origin.
  Both paths now treat leading-slash as workspace-rooted while keeping the workspace boundary check intact (e.g. `/etc/passwd` is still rejected). (#961)

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- **MCP catalog Notion entry** — switched from the legacy `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` JSON-string form (with a hardcoded `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`, three years stale) to the official `NOTION_TOKEN` env var, which the upstream README marks as recommended. Users who installed Notion via the catalog before this change still work, but their `~/mulmoclaude/config/mcp.json` keeps the old shape — re-install from Settings → MCP to pick up the new env shape and access the 2025-09-03 API features (data sources, 7 new tools). (#852 / #860)
- **Wiki / sources help text**: align on-disk YAML key names so the help-file driven hints match the keys the agent emits (#855 / #861).
- **E2E**: stop flakiness in the chat-target notification test (#863); update Notion catalog test for the new `NOTION_TOKEN` env shape.

### Changed

- **CI**: shard e2e across 2 parallel runners; add `restore-keys` + `packages/dist` cache for Windows speedup; skip `lint_test` + `e2e` on docs / plans / markdown-only PRs (#862, #864).

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### Highlights

- **Notifications grew up** — macOS Reminders sink (Darwin-only, opt-out by default via `MACOS_REMINDER_NOTIFICATIONS=0`); `notify` exposed as an MCP tool so the agent can fire notifications directly; deep-link permalinks let a notification jump to its target todo / wiki page / chat session; per-item read state — clicking or dismissing a single notification decreases the badge count.
- **Sources got its own page** — `/sources` replaces the Source Manager built-in role with a page-scoped chat composer plus filter chips by fetcher kind / schedule. Suggested queries on the Sources view start chats already aware of the active filter.
- **News viewer (`/news`)** — unread management UI, per-article chat composer that scopes the new session to that article.
- **`manageScheduler` split into `manageCalendar` + `manageAutomations`** (#824) — clearer per-surface tools; legacy view-only fallback keeps pre-split chat sessions readable.
- **MCP catalog UI** (#823) — Phase 1 ships a curated list of preset MCP servers with checkbox install for config-free entries; Phase 2 adds a per-server config form and 6 new entries.
- **`presentForm` in General role** (#826) — choice / yes-no / feature-toggle prompts surface as clickable forms; submit text reads as a markdown bullet list (`- {label}: {value}`) instead of a JSON wrapper, so chat history stays human-readable.
- **Wiki**: tag-based filtering on the index, "Create this wiki page" empty-state CTA, "Lint My Wiki" button, interactive GFM task checkboxes that round-trip to disk, Unicode hashtags accepted in index bullets.
- **Session history side panel** (#728) — independent toggle (canvas and history can coexist), expand-to-full-width, badge moved onto the toggle button. The standalone `/history` route is retired in favor of the panel.
- **Files view** (#832) — system-managed file description banner; file-tree icons tinted by edit policy (read-only / system-managed / writable).
- **Thinking… indicator** (#839, #731 PR2) — shared across slide and stack views, per-tool elapsed time, gated on whether _this_ session is running rather than the global isRunning.
- **Server observability** (#779) — structured `log.{error,warn,info,debug}` audit; layered logging on 10+ routes (plugin / files / todos / chart / config / html / roles / sessions / skills / image).
- **Smoke-tested `mulmoclaude` tarball in CI** (#667) — pre-publish smoke workflow verifies the npm package boots before release.
- **Slack ack reaction** (`@mulmobridge/slack@0.4.0`) — `SLACK_ACK_REACTION=1` adds 👀 on receive so the user sees the bot saw the message before the agent finishes (#695).
- **Per-platform default role for relay** — `RELAY_<PLATFORM>_DEFAULT_ROLE` lets relay assign different default roles per platform (#739).

### Added

- **`/news`** viewer with unread management; per-article chat composer.
- **`/sources`** page with chat composer + filter chips by fetcher kind / schedule; suggested-queries list.
- **macOS Reminders notification sink** — Darwin-only, on by default, disable with `MACOS_REMINDER_NOTIFICATIONS=0`; title/body passed via argv (not osascript attribute) to close a string-injection vector (#789).
- **`notify` MCP tool** — agent can fire push-style notifications directly.
- **Notification permalinks** — every notification deep-links to its target item (#762).
- **`manageCalendar` + `manageAutomations`** plugins (split from `manageScheduler`, #824).
- **MCP catalog UI** — preset server list, checkbox install, per-server config form, 6 curated entries (#823).
- **`presentForm` in General role** with prompt nudge for choice questions and `required: true` instruction (#826).
- **Wiki**: tag filter chips on index, "Create this wiki page" CTA on empty pages, "Lint My Wiki" header button, interactive GFM task-checkbox toggle (#775), Unicode hashtag support, per-page chat composer extracted into reusable `PageChatComposer`.
- **Files**: system-managed file description banner, edit-policy-tinted file-tree icons (#832).
- **`fetchWithTimeout` helper** — `AbortController`-based; wired into MCP + X API call sites (#722).
- **Layered logging** on plugin routes / files / todos / chart / config / html / roles / sessions / skills / image (#779).
- **Smoke-test workflow** for the published `mulmoclaude` tarball — dep audit, drift check, tarball smoke, CI artifact upload (#667).
- **Slack ack reaction** — opt-in `SLACK_ACK_REACTION` env (#695).
- **Per-platform default role** — `RELAY_<PLATFORM>_DEFAULT_ROLE` (#739).
- **Artifact directory sharding** by `YYYY/MM` to keep folders manageable (#764).
- **Side-panel expand toggle** — full-width session-history view (#728 follow-up).
- **History filter via URL path param** — `/history/unread`, `/history/scheduler`, … bookmarkable (#677).
- **Suggestions trigger** moved into the composer button column for closer reach.
- **Tab-bar origin badge overlaid on role icon**; bold unread labels.

### Changed

- **`manageScheduler` is now split** into `manageCalendar` + `manageAutomations`. Pre-split sessions render via a legacy view-only fallback (#824). See **Breaking Changes** below.
- **`/history` retired** — history is now the side panel only; the route + entrance composable were removed.
- **Source Manager and Role Manager built-in roles removed** — sources live on `/sources`, roles on `/roles`.
- **`currentRoleId` is user-owned**; `RoleSelector` ownership refactored so role state isn't trapped in a chat composable (#714).
- **`presentForm` submit text** — JSON `{"formSubmission":{...}}` → markdown bullet list (`- {label}: {value}`). Free-form text values use indented continuation; checkbox selections render as a nested sub-list to avoid comma-ambiguity (#826).
- **Slug rule unified** across journal / todos / wiki / files (#732). Single canonical `slugify` (`server/utils/slug.ts`) — non-ASCII deterministically hashed (16-char base64url SHA-256 prefix), ASCII lowercased + hyphenated. `isValidSlug` and the slug-output cap both moved from 64 → 120 chars. **Breaking** — see below.
- **`FilterChip` component** unified across panels — Sources, History, Wiki tag filter all share one chip implementation.
- **Top-bar and panel-header control sizing** standardized (`h-8` square / `h-8 px-2.5 pill` / `flex items-center gap-2 px-3 py-2` row container). Panel-header layouts collapse into one row to match.
- **`@mulmobridge/slack`** v0.3.0 → **v0.4.1** — ack reaction, then a stable-version bump as part of the bridge package sweep.
- **`@mulmobridge/protocol`** → **v0.1.4**, **`@mulmobridge/chat-service`** → **v0.1.2**, **`@mulmobridge/client`** → **v0.1.3** → **v0.1.4** — opaque `options` passthrough from bridge env to the host app, narrower `bridgeOptions` types.
- **`@mulmobridge/cli`** → **v0.1.3**, **`@mulmobridge/telegram`** → **v0.1.3**, all other 22 bridges → **v0.1.1** — workspace-dep range tightening + README catch-up sweep.

### Fixed

- **Wiki**: per-entry tag chips set the filter (no longer toggle the active filter off); index-table images resolve under `data/wiki/`; distinguishes missing vs empty page; route GET `/api/wiki?slug=...` through `buildPageResponse`; backtick-stripped index-table headers; tag filter cleared on Index/Log/Lint navigation; toolbar padding + frontmatter visibility cleaned up.
- **Files**: large audio/video preview in `/files` + audio-file icon; PDF filename derived from content with `yyyy-mm-dd` suffix (#831).
- **Image plugin**: workspace-rooted refs + bridge timeout (#782); legacy `markdowns/` and `spreadsheets/` paths migrated and rejected at the validator (#773).
- **Notifications**: per-item read state — click or dismiss decreases the badge; chat-target test pre-seeds a session to avoid the `/chat` auto-create race; agent-completion bell muted (duplicate of session panel badge).
- **Sessions**: `isRunning` split into global vs active-session scoped; URL query preserved when `activateSession` runs on URL-driven path; current session id cleared off `/chat` so unread doesn't clear on background finish.
- **Skills Run button** routes through `startNewChat` so the user sees the response.
- **Spreadsheet preview cards** simplified; e2e canonical paths under `artifacts/spreadsheets/`.
- **i18n**: 6 user-facing English strings translated (closes #713); German typographic-quote handling rule added (`„` U+201E / `"` U+201C in `de.ts`); aria-labels on send/attach/suggestions buttons.
- **Settings**: reference + workspace dirs auto-save on add/remove (#716); modal-level Save/Cancel dropped (Tools tab keeps its own); MCP form serializes `persistMcp` and updated E2E for new save UX.
- **Wiki self-heal**: `taskPersistChain` recovers when `persistWikiPage` rejects (#795).
- **Build / CI**: i18n cache reset between wiki page-save tests (Windows / Node 24 flake); Playwright runs on dedicated port 45173; ci-stub for Claude Code CLI in launcher pre-flight; smoke-verified mulmoclaude tarball uploaded as workflow artifact.
- Many follow-up commits addressing Codex / CodeRabbit / human review feedback across ~30 PRs.

### Security

- **macOS Reminders sink**: title/body now passed via argv to `osascript` instead of the system attribute, closing a string-injection vector that could land in a Reminder if a notification body contained `osascript`-meta characters (#789).
- **Sandbox + smoke**: smoke driver runs with `DISABLE_SANDBOX=1` on CI (no `~/.claude` available), but ships sandbox-on for end-users.

### Breaking Changes

- **`manageScheduler` is split into `manageCalendar` + `manageAutomations`** (#824). Pre-split chat sessions still render their tool-results via a view-only legacy fallback (`legacyManageSchedulerEntry`), but agents can no longer call `manageScheduler` — new prompts must target the right half (`manageCalendar` for events / `manageAutomations` for recurring tasks).
- **Source Manager and Role Manager built-in roles removed**. Existing chat sessions keep working; new manageSource / manageRoles calls flow through their respective dedicated pages (`/sources`, `/roles`) and any role still on the legacy id falls back to `general`.
- **Slug rule unification (#732)** — same impact as documented in the prior `[Unreleased]`:
  - **Journal topics with non-ASCII names**: `slugify` previously dropped non-ASCII characters and collided distinct Japanese names onto a single `topic.md`. After #732 each distinct name maps to a unique `<hash>.md`. **Migration**: none — old `topic.md` files become orphans under `<workspace>/conversations/summaries/topics/`; the journal regenerates fresh summary files on the next pass and operators may delete the orphans at their own pace.
  - **Todo columns**: default column id `in_progress` becomes `in-progress`, new custom-column ids use the hyphen separator. Existing `data/todos/columns.json` is read as-is so workspaces keep their stored ids; the new defaults apply only to fresh workspaces.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Highlights

- **13 new messaging bridges** bring the total bridge count to 20+ — bots can now talk to Mastodon, Bluesky, Chatwork, XMPP / Jabber, Rocket.Chat, Signal, Microsoft Teams, Viber, LINE Works, Nostr, plus three generic connectors (Webhook / Twilio SMS / IMAP-SMTP Email).
- **Path-based URLs** for Wiki (`/wiki/index`, `/wiki/pages/<slug>`), Files (`/files/<path>`), History (`/history`), and Chat (`/chat/:id`, lands on the latest session when naked). Back/forward/bookmark work everywhere; the browser history IS the navigation source of truth.
- **Internationalization goes live** — vue-i18n skeleton (#559), auto-detect locale from the browser, and **8 locales** ship out of the box (en, ja, zh, ko, es, pt-BR, fr, de). Dozens of components had hard-coded strings extracted into the locale files across 17 extraction batches.
- **Agent respects the user's timezone** — requests now carry the browser's IANA zone, and the system prompt tells the model to interpret bare times ("15:00") in that zone without re-asking every turn. Scheduler UI mirrors the change — daily triggers render in the viewer's local zone (`Daily 05:00 GMT+9`) instead of UTC.
- **Favicon rebuilt around the mascot** (#470 follow-up): mascot logo in the rounded frame, background color carries state (idle / running / done / error), red dot surfaces **any** unread session, not just the active one.
- **Dev-server port fallback** — `yarn dev` no longer crashes when 3001 is already in use; the walk-forward logic from `npx mulmoclaude` now lives in a shared `server/utils/port.mjs` and drives both entry points.

### Added

- **Bridges** (13 new; all new packages, `v0.1.0` each):
  - `@mulmobridge/mastodon` — subscribes to the user notification stream (WebSocket), handles DMs and optionally public mentions, inherits visibility on reply, forwards image attachments, chained thread replies for long output, proactive direct-visibility push mentions the recipient.
  - `@mulmobridge/bluesky` — polls `chat.bsky.convo.getLog` via the atproto-proxy header, forwards DMs, auto-refreshes the session JWT on 401, cursor-at-startup for missed DMs.
  - `@mulmobridge/chatwork` — Japanese business chat, polls unread messages per room via REST, strips Chatwork markup.
  - `@mulmobridge/xmpp` — XMPP / Jabber over TLS with JID + password.
  - `@mulmobridge/rocketchat` — personal-access-token auth, paginated `im.list` + `im.history`, seeds cursor to `now - pollInterval` on first discovery so the message that created the DM room isn't lost.
  - `@mulmobridge/signal` — talks to a local [signal-cli-rest-api](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api) daemon, groups routed to `group.<id>` chatIds (not mixed with DMs), E.164 source validation, module-scoped exponential backoff on reconnect.
  - `@mulmobridge/teams` — Microsoft Teams via Bot Framework (`botbuilder` SDK). Conversation-reference cache for push, AAD object-id allowlist. Requires a public URL.
  - `@mulmobridge/webhook` — generic HTTP bridge; POST JSON, get the AI reply in the response body. Optional `x-webhook-secret`.
  - `@mulmobridge/twilio-sms` — Twilio Programmable Messaging, `X-Twilio-Signature` HMAC-SHA1 verification, number-based allowlist.
  - `@mulmobridge/email` — IMAP poll / SMTP reply with threading preserved (`In-Reply-To` + `References`).
  - `@mulmobridge/line-works` — enterprise LINE via service-account JWT → OAuth, separate from consumer LINE.
  - `@mulmobridge/nostr` — NIP-04 encrypted DMs across multiple relays, periodic resubscribe after relay drops, last-seen cursor persisted to `~/.mulmoclaude/nostr-cursor.json` so restarts don't lose messages, hex / nsec key input with pubkey allowlist.
  - `@mulmobridge/viber` — Viber Public Account bot, `X-Viber-Content-Signature` HMAC-SHA256.
- **Wiki**: per-page chat composer (`pages/<slug>` leaf view) that spawns a new session scoped to the page; back-arrow now walks browser history instead of forcing index; slug path-traversal rejection; empty-slug guard; exact-title lookup for non-ASCII pages.
- **Files view**: path-based URL (`/files/<path>`) with query-form back-compat, internal workspace link router routes markdown-embedded links to the right view.
- **History view**: promoted to `/history`, "unread only" filter pill, session-origin filter (human / scheduler / skill / bridge).
- **Chat**: naked `/chat` lands on the most recent session; MulmoClaude logo/title click resumes the latest session; `/chat/:id` push via `router.push` (no replace).
- **i18n**: vue-i18n skeleton, auto-detect locale from `navigator.language` when `VITE_LOCALE` unset, 7 new locale files (ja, zh, ko, es, pt-BR, fr, de — en remains the source of truth), vue-i18n lint wiring via `batch/i18n-dump.ts`.
- **UI**: MulmoClaude mascot-based favicon with state-colored background + red unread dot, scheduler frequency hints, ChatInput attach-file discoverability, source labels on preview cards.
- **Server**: session-origin tag on every session, chat-index + journal force-run env flags, reference directory mounts into Docker sandbox.
- **Canvas**: PNG file as source of truth so drawings survive reload; POST `/api/canvas` + PUT `/api/images/:filename` endpoints with unit tests.
- **Prompt**: compact plugin bullets, per-section size monitoring with threshold warning, summary-only inlining for large help files.
- **Tests**: E2E right-sidebar hidden on plugin views, `/files/<path>` character coverage, workspace link routing unit + E2E, ChatInput attach discoverability, internal-link-navigation assertion for path-based Files, regression tests for session behavior fixes.

### Changed

- **`@mulmobridge/slack`** (v0.2.0 → **v0.3.0**): `SLACK_SESSION_GRANULARITY=thread` auto-creates a Slack thread on the first bot reply to a top-level channel post; unrelated top-level messages now get one thread per topic. `channel` (default) and `auto` unchanged; DMs unaffected (#661 / closes #658).
- **`@mulmobridge/client`** (v0.1.1 → **v0.1.2**): exports `chunkText` from `./text`; required by every new bridge.
- **`@mulmobridge/mock-server`** (v0.1.0 → **v0.1.1**): internal refactor + README catch-up.
- **`@mulmobridge/relay`** (v0.1.0 → **v0.2.0**): four new platform plugins — WhatsApp, Messenger, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams — plus Durable Object hibernation recovery and subpath exports.
- Dev server port resolution: shared `server/utils/port.mjs` drives both `yarn dev` and the `npx mulmoclaude` launcher; explicit `PORT=3099` exits on conflict, default walks forward through 20 slots.
- Scheduler UI: daily triggers render in viewer's local timezone (e.g. Tokyo sees `Daily 05:00 GMT+9` instead of `Daily 20:00 UTC`).
- Agent prompt: new `## Time & Timezone` section instructs the model to default bare time expressions to the user's browser timezone and only clarify for explicit cross-zone mentions. "Today's date" is now computed in that zone.
- Wiki tabs (Index / Log / Lint) styled to match PluginLauncher; PDF download button aligned with TextResponse view; index rows condensed to single line.
- Bridges moved from `packages/<name>/` into `packages/bridges/<name>/` subdirectory.
- CLAUDE.md: i18n rule — all 8 locales must move in lockstep; `id-length` lint promoted to `error`.
- ChatInput: focus expansion dropped, padding tightened, buttons equalized.
- Tool-results card timestamps overlaid on top border instead of inline.
- Express request-id header normalization (CRLF stripped before multi-paragraph plugin check).

### Fixed

- **Wiki**: back arrow walks browser history instead of resetting to index (#wiki-nav); same-origin markdown links no longer trigger full page reloads; relative links in text-response don't navigate the SPA; cross-route query bleed; redundant mount fetch on `/wiki` cancelled; `navError` hoisted above the immediate URL watcher; originating page retained in history when starting a chat.
- **Session**: role switch from a non-chat page no longer creates a phantom chat session; sidebar preview links don't spawn new sessions; re-selecting the active session from a non-chat page navigates correctly; fall back to a new session when top-session resume fails; URL session id read directly to avoid watcher timing race.
- **Right sidebar**: hidden along with its toggle on non-chat views (#652).
- **Mastodon**: image-only DMs no longer dropped; chunked replies chain into one readable thread; fail loudly on a create-status response missing `id` (previously left stale `prevId` chaining onto the wrong parent).
- **Rocket.Chat**: `im.history` / `im.list` pagination (previously silently trimmed past 50 / 100 entries); cursor rewind on first DM discovery.
- **Signal**: E.164 source check (UUID-only senders would 400 on reply); `backoffMs` hoisted to module scope so reconnect actually backs off; `dataMessage.groupV2.id` / `groupInfo.groupId` routing so group chats don't collapse into the sender's DM.
- **Nostr**: auto-resubscribe every 5 min to survive relay WebSocket drops; last-seen cursor persisted so a >60 s restart doesn't lose DMs.
- **Bluesky**: cursor-at-startup so DMs delivered while the bridge was down still flow in on first poll.
- **Teams (relay)**: webhook auth hardened against SSRF and impersonation — `serviceurl` claim cross-check, `channelId === "msteams"` check, JWK endorsement check for MultiTenant, fail-closed allowlist when `aadObjectId` missing.
- **Scheduler / prompt**: plugin-prompt paragraph detection normalizes CRLF.
- **i18n**: pluginWiki schema drift across pt-BR / fr / de / es / ko / zh fixed in multiple rounds; literal `@` in stdio argsPlaceholder escaped (the Intl linked-message compiler was turning `@modelcontextprotocol/...` into a runtime error); silence vue-i18n HTML warning; missing chatPlaceholder / chatSend / pdf keys aligned across all locales.
- **E2E**: IME Enter test deflaked by collapsing the `compositionstart → compositionend → keydown` dispatches into a single `page.evaluate()` (per-hop latency was blowing past the 30 ms race window on CI webkit).
- **Slack**: session-granularity env invalidation now rejects invalid values up front; id-length lint clean-up across the package.
- **Settings / MCP**: stdio form rendering regression (vue-i18n link-compile error).
- **Roles**: role switch on non-chat pages no longer creates a session.
- **Build**: i18n cache location and `dumpi18n` wired into lint so the rule can see every locale.

### Security

- **`@mulmobridge/relay`**: Teams webhook auth — reject bodies whose `serviceUrl` doesn't match the JWT's `serviceurl` claim (SSRF prevention), enforce `channelId === "msteams"`, require `msteams` in JWK `endorsements` for MultiTenant keys, fail-closed allowlist.
- **`@mulmobridge/nostr`**: Tight IANA regex + `Intl.DateTimeFormat` round-trip validation on any timezone string before it lands in the system prompt, so a hostile client can't inject newlines or instructions via a crafted payload.
- **`@mulmobridge/signal`**: E.164 source validation — the `/v2/send` API requires a phone number, and a UUID-only sender would quietly 400; now we drop instead.
- **Agent prompt**: IANA timezone string sanitisation before it reaches the system prompt.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-22

### Highlights

- **`npx mulmoclaude` one-command launch (#533, #535)** — self-contained npm package that ships server TypeScript + Vite client; runs via `tsx`, opens the browser, auto-falls back to the next free port if 3001 is busy. Prints a ready banner once the HTTP endpoint actually responds.
- **MulmoBridge Relay (#456)** — Cloudflare Workers + Durable Object webhook proxy; server-side WebSocket client with hibernation recovery. `/setup-relay` skill for interactive deploy.
- **Bridge session switching (#489)** — `/sessions`, `/switch`, and `/history` commands from inside a bridge. Session list scales to 200 with pagination.
- **Session origin tracking (#486)** — sessions tagged `human` / `scheduler` / `skill` / `bridge`; origin icons + filter UI in the history sidebar.
- **Scheduler Phase 3+** — task dependencies (`dependsOn` for ordered execution, #465 Phase 3), system task schedule overrides via config file (#493), live-update API for overrides.
- **Source auto-discovery (#469)** — arXiv pipeline keyed off user interests; news notification + concierge prompt (#466).

- `mulmoclaude` npm package layout: ships `server/` TS + `client/` dist + `src/` shared; `prepublishOnly` hook runs `prepare-dist.js`
- CI: Windows runner pinned to `windows-2022`, node_modules caching enabled, job-level timeouts

### Fixed

- Express 5 wildcard route (`app.get("*")` → `/{*splat}`) — previously crashed only in NODE_ENV=production
- Session-store: gate storeless publish to generation events only; type-guard generation payloads; await persistHasUnread in storeless drain
- StackView auto-scroll during assistant text streaming
- Role selector reverting to prior session's role on tab switch
- manageRoles rename now deletes the built-in-id override file
- manageRoles hardened against two hostile payload shapes
- Relay client: survive Durable Object hibernation via `getWebSockets()`; response queue + URL builder hardening; try/catch around dispatch
