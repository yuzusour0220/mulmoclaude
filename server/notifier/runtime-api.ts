// Plugin-facing notifier API. The host attaches a per-plugin
// instance of `NotifierRuntimeApi` to the `PluginRuntime` it
// constructs for each plugin (see `server/plugins/runtime.ts`).
// `pluginPkg` is auto-bound to the calling plugin's pkg name so
// plugins cannot publish under another plugin's namespace.
//
// Plugin authors access this surface via type assertion:
//
//   import type { PluginRuntime } from "gui-chat-protocol";
//   import type { MulmoclaudeRuntime } from "<mulmoclaude>/notifier/runtime-api";
//   export default definePlugin((runtime: PluginRuntime) => {
//     const { notifier } = runtime as MulmoclaudeRuntime;
//     // notifier.publish(...) / notifier.clear(...)
//   });
//
// Once the API stabilises, this is a candidate for upstreaming
// into gui-chat-protocol so the cast goes away.
