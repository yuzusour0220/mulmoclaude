# Collection skills — build a data app from a schema

A **collection skill** is a skill directory that ships a `schema.json` next to
its `SKILL.md`. The schema declares an entire data-driven app — its data model,
cross-record relations, rendered UI, computed fields, and per-record action
buttons — in one small JSON file. You author the schema, you write the records
(one JSON file each), and you are the runtime for any behaviour the schema
can't express declaratively. The host contains **zero** knowledge of any
specific collection: it just reads the DSL and renders a table / calendar /
form / detail view, and serves a REST surface. No database, no migration tool, no ORM — a
`schema.json` plus a folder of `<id>.json` records **is** the app.

This is the project philosophy made concrete: *the workspace is the database;
files are the source of truth; you are the intelligent interface.*

## Anatomy of a collection skill

You **author** the skill under `data/skills/<slug>/` (a plain, writable data
dir). A host-side hook then **mirrors** the files into `.claude/skills/<slug>/`,
which is where the host actually discovers and renders the collection from:

```
data/skills/<slug>/            ← YOU write here (Write / Edit)
  SKILL.md          ← instructions you read later (how to CRUD the records)
  schema.json       ← the DSL: data model + relations + UI + actions
  templates/*.md    ← natural-language bodies for actions (only if it has actions)
        │
        │  host's skill-bridge hook mirrors these three file kinds
        ▼
.claude/skills/<slug>/         ← host reads here (do NOT write here directly)
  SKILL.md  ·  schema.json  ·  templates/*.md

data/<name>/items/             ← the records (separate from the skill dir)
  <id>.json         ← one record per file (you write; host reads + renders)
```

- **Author under `data/skills/<slug>/`, NEVER `.claude/skills/<slug>/`
  directly.** Claude Code gates writes into `.claude/` (it's the agent's own
  config surface) and the host GUI can't answer that prompt, so a direct write
  hangs/fails. Writing under `data/skills/` has no such gate; the bridge hook
  copies `SKILL.md`, `schema.json`, and `templates/*.md` across for you and
  triggers a re-scan, so the collection appears at `/collections/<slug>`
  without a restart. (Other files you drop in `data/skills/<slug>/` — a README,
  scratch notes — stay put and are NOT mirrored.)
- **Do NOT use the `mc-` prefix** for skills you create. `mc-*` is reserved for
  the bundled presets (`mc-cooking-coach`, `mc-library`, `mc-wiki-*`,
  `mc-manage-*`); the server overwrites those on every boot, so your edits would
  be lost. (The billing collections — `clients`, `worklog`, `invoice`, `profile`
  — are now recipe-authored under these plain slugs, NOT `mc-` presets; see the
  worked reference below.)
- **`<slug>` rules**: lowercase letters, digits, hyphens; no leading / trailing
  hyphen; 1–64 chars (e.g. `recipes`, `book-club`, `gym-log`). It doubles as the
  URL (`/collections/<slug>`) and the directory name.
- The user opens the collection at **`/collections/<slug>`**. Link a specific
  record with `?selected=<id>` (e.g. `/collections/recipes?selected=carbonara`).

## SKILL.md

Standard skill front-matter plus prose teaching *future-you* how to maintain the
records. Keep it short and operational:

```markdown
---
name: recipes
description: A personal recipe box. Use whenever the user asks to add, list,
  edit, or remove a recipe. Records live at `data/recipes/items/<id>.json`
  (one JSON per recipe); the user views them at `/collections/recipes`,
  rendered from `schema.json` by the host. You do all I/O via Read / Write /
  Edit on the JSON files.
---

# Recipes (schema-driven collection)

## Record shape
- `id` — kebab-case slug, primary key (the filename, no extension)
- `title` — string, required
- ... (one bullet per field; note which are host-computed and must NOT be written)

## What to do
**Add / List / Update / Delete** — derive an id, Read/Write/Edit the JSON.
List the directory first and pick a fresh slug rather than overwriting.
Don't recite the whole table in chat. After adding or updating a record,
call `presentCollection` (with the collection slug and the record's id) to
show it inline; for a plain "show/list" request, call `presentCollection`
with just the slug.
```

Write the `description` so it tells *you* (in a future session) exactly when to
reach for this skill and where the records live — that text is what gets matched
when the user makes a request.

## schema.json — the DSL

Top-level shape (validated on discovery; a malformed schema is logged and
skipped, never crashes the host):

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `title` | Human name shown in the sidebar / header. Required. |
| `icon` | A **Material Icons** name (`receipt_long`, `people`, `schedule`, `menu_book`). Required. |
| `dataPath` | Workspace-relative records folder, e.g. `data/recipes/items`. Must stay under the workspace. Required. |
| `primaryKey` | The field name whose value is the filename. That field MUST set `primary: true`. Required. |
| `singleton` | Optional. When set, at most one record exists, pinned to this exact id (e.g. `me`). Host pre-fills + locks the create form and hides Add once it exists. |
| `fields` | Ordered map of field-name → field spec. **Insertion order = column order** in the table. Required. |
| `actions` | Optional array of per-record buttons (see below). |
| `completionField` | Optional. Name of the field whose value marks an item as "done" — when set, item-create fires a bell notification that clears once the field reaches one of `completionDoneValues`. Must name a real field in `fields`. Paired with `completionDoneValues` (both set, or both omitted). |
| `completionDoneValues` | Optional. Non-empty array of values that count as "done" for `completionField` (e.g. `["Done"]`, `["paid", "void"]`). Compared as strings. |
| `notifyWhen` | Optional. A `when` predicate (`{ "field": "...", "in": [...] }`) that **gates** the completion bell: fire it only for records matching the predicate (e.g. `{ "field": "priority", "in": ["high", "urgent"] }`). Requires `completionField`; `field` must name a real field. Absent ⇒ notify for every open record. |
| `displayField` | Optional. Name of a field whose value is shown as the human-readable label in the completion notification's title (e.g. `Contacts: Jane Doe` instead of the opaque primaryKey). Must name a real field in `fields`. Falls back to the primaryKey value when unset or when the record's value is empty. |
| `triggerField` | Optional. Name of a `date` field that **delays** the completion bell until that date arrives (instead of firing on create). Requires `completionField` / `completionDoneValues` (the bell still clears via the done value). Must name a real `date` field. See "Time-gated bells" below. |
| `triggerLeadDays` | Optional. Non-negative integer: fire the bell this many days **before** `triggerField` (e.g. `10` = "remind me 10 days early"). Requires `triggerField`. Default `0` (fire on the trigger date). |
| `spawn` | Optional. Host-driven **recurrence**: when a record reaches a configured value (e.g. `status: paid`), the host auto-creates the next record with a forward-advanced `triggerField` date. Requires `triggerField`. See "Recurring obligations" below. |
| `calendarField` | Optional. Name of a `date` field that anchors the **calendar view** (a month grid; each record lands on its date cell). When unset, the table↔calendar toggle still appears if the schema has any `date` field — the first one is used, switchable in-view. Set this to pin a specific anchor. Must name a real `date` field. See "Calendar view" below. |
| `calendarEndField` | Optional. A second `date` field marking the END of a multi-day span on the calendar (the record renders across `calendarField` → this date). Requires `calendarField`. Must name a real `date` field. |
| `kanbanField` | Optional. Name of an `enum` field that groups records into columns on the **Kanban board** (one column per declared value). When unset, the Kanban toggle still appears if the schema has any `enum` field — the first one is used, switchable in-view. Set this to pin a specific group field. Must name a real `enum` field. See "Kanban view" below. |

### Field types

`string` · `text` (multi-line) · `email` · `number` · `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) ·
`boolean` · `markdown` · `money` · `enum` · `ref` · `embed` · `table` ·
`derived` · `image` · `toggle`

Every field spec needs a `type` and a `label`. Extra keys by type:

- **`enum`** — `values: ["draft", "sent", "paid"]` (non-empty strings). Renders
  a `<select>`; stored as a plain string.
- **`money`** — `currency: "USD"` (ISO 4217, defaults to USD). Stored as a plain
  decimal; currency is display-only.
- **`ref`** — `to: "<target-slug>"`. Stores the target record's primary-key
  slug; host renders a clickable link + a dropdown picker populated from the
  target collection. Example: `{ "type": "ref", "to": "clients", "label": "Client" }`.
  A `derived` field on the same record can also **dereference** a `ref` to read
  a numeric column off the record it points at — see the cross-collection
  formula syntax below.
- **`embed`** — `to: "<target-slug>"`, `id: "<record-id>"`. Pulls a *fixed*
  record from another collection into the read-only detail view (display-only,
  **nothing is stored** on this record). Example: an invoice embedding the
  user's own profile: `{ "type": "embed", "to": "profile", "id": "me" }`.
- **`table`** — `of: { <col>: <sub-field-spec>, ... }`. An array of rows. Each
  sub-field is a flat spec; sub-fields **cannot** be `table` or `derived`
  (no nested tables, no computed columns).
- **`derived`** — `formula: "<expr>"`, optional `display` (`number` default, or
  `money` / `string` / `date`) and `currency`. **Read-only, host-computed** —
  you NEVER write derived values into the JSON; the host recomputes them on
  every render and the form refuses to persist them.
- **`image`** — stores a **workspace-relative image path** as a plain string
  (e.g. `data/attachments/2026/05/<id>.jpg` — the exact path from an
  `[Attached file: ...]` marker when the user attaches a photo). The host
  renders it as an `<img>` in the **detail view** (it is intentionally not a
  list-table column — a per-row image fetch is too expensive for a large
  collection). No extra keys. Great for photos like a business card: read the
  details off the attached image and write its path into the image field.
  Write the bare workspace-relative path — never an `/api/files/raw?...` URL.
- **`toggle`** — `field: "<enum-field>"`, `onValue`, `offValue`. A checkbox that
  is a pure **projection** of an `enum` field — it **stores nothing** of its own
  (like `derived`/`embed`). Checked when the projected enum equals `onValue`;
  toggling writes `onValue` / `offValue` back to that enum. `onValue`/`offValue`
  must be members of the enum's `values`. Use it to front a kanban `status` with
  a "done" checkbox while keeping the enum as the single source of truth — e.g.
  `{ "type": "toggle", "label": "Done", "field": "status", "onValue": "Done", "offValue": "Todo" }`.
  Renders an interactive checkbox in the list table and on the kanban card (when
  it projects the board's group field); read-only in the detail view.
  **A todo / task list should almost always include one** — it's the row/card
  "done" checkbox. Without it, `status` only shows as a dropdown and a kanban
  column, with no checkbox to tick. `offValue` is the status to return to on
  uncheck (the default open column, e.g. `"Todo"`).

### Conditional field visibility (`when`)

Any field may carry an optional `when: { field, in: [...] }` predicate to hide
itself until another field on the same record matches — the same shape used to
gate `actions`. The field shows only when `String(record[when.field])` is one of
`in`; absent ⇒ always shown. `when.field` MUST name another top-level field
(validated on discovery).

```json
"visited":    { "type": "boolean", "label": "Visited" },
"rating":     { "type": "number",  "label": "Rating", "when": { "field": "visited", "in": ["true"] } }
```

Here `rating` stays hidden until `visited` is checked (booleans stringify, so
match `"true"` / `"false"`). The gate applies everywhere the field renders: the
list cell goes **blank**, the edit-form input hides/shows **live** as the gating
field changes, and the detail view omits it. It is **purely presentational** —
a hidden field's stored value is never cleared, so re-matching the gate restores
it. Use it for fields that only make sense in a given state (a rating before
you've visited, a shipped-date before an order ships). Only honoured on
top-level fields, not inside a `table`'s `of`.

### Derived-formula syntax

A tiny expression evaluated against the record (pure evaluator, no `eval`;
returns `null` on any failure). Supported:

- arithmetic `+ - * /` and parentheses
- identifier references to **top-level** fields (`subtotal * taxRate`)
- `sum(tableField[].col)` — sum a column across table rows
- `sum(tableField[].col * tableField[].col)` — sum a per-row product
- `<refField>.<col>` — **dereference a `ref` field** and read a numeric column
  off the record it points at (a live cross-collection lookup)

Example: `subtotal` = `sum(lineItems[].quantity * lineItems[].rate)`,
`tax` = `subtotal * taxRate`, `total` = `subtotal + tax`.

#### Cross-collection lookups (`<refField>.<col>`)

When a field is a `ref` to another collection, a `derived` formula can reach
into the referenced record and pull a numeric column out of it. This lets one
collection compute against data **owned by another** without copying that data.

Canonical use — a portfolio that values holdings against a separate price list:

```jsonc
// my-portfolio/schema.json  (one record per holding)
"fields": {
  "ticker": { "type": "ref", "to": "stock-quotes", "label": "Stock" },  // stores e.g. "AAPL"
  "shares": { "type": "number", "label": "Shares" },
  "value":  { "type": "derived", "formula": "shares * ticker.price",     // ← reads price from the quotes row
              "display": "money", "currency": "USD", "label": "Value" }
}
```

Here `ticker.price` resolves the `ticker` ref to its `stock-quotes` record and
reads that record's `price`. `price` lives **only** in `stock-quotes`; the
portfolio never stores a copy, so a quote refresh in `stock-quotes` is the
single source of truth for every holding's value.

Rules and limits:

- The left side must be a `ref` field **on this same record**; the right side is
  a single column name. Only the `<field>.<col>` shape — no `a.b.c` chains, no
  dereferencing inside `sum(...)`.
- The referenced column must hold a number (or a numeric string). A missing
  column, a non-numeric value, or a **dangling ref** (the slug points at a row
  that doesn't exist) makes the whole formula fail soft to an em-dash (`—`),
  same as any other formula error.
- The referenced column may itself be a **`derived`** field in the target
  collection (the host computes the target's own derived fields before the
  lookup) — *as long as* that target formula is target-local. A target derived
  field that in turn derefs a **third** collection won't resolve (only one hop
  is loaded) and reads as `—`.
- The target collection is loaded **when the page opens**. If a value changes in
  the target while the viewing collection is already open (e.g. you refresh a
  price in `stock-quotes` in another tab), the derived value updates on the next
  reload — not instantly across tabs.
- It's still per-record: each holding computes `shares * ticker.price` from its
  own `ticker`/`shares`. To total the portfolio, add a one-record summary
  collection or read the values off the list view — there is no cross-row sum
  over a joined column.

### Actions (per-record buttons)

Each entry in `actions` renders a button in the read-only detail view. The only
`kind` today is `"chat"`: clicking it starts a **new chat in a role**, seeded
with a template + the record data — the role then does the work with its tools.
This is how hard logic the schema can't express (PDF generation, bookkeeping
journals, drafting an email) gets delegated to natural language.

```json
{
  "id": "pdf",                      // unique within the schema
  "label": "Generate PDF",          // button text (English)
  "icon": "picture_as_pdf",         // Material Icons name
  "kind": "chat",
  "role": "accounting",             // which role the new chat runs in
  "template": "templates/invoice.md", // skill-relative; no `..`, no leading `/`
  "when": { "field": "status", "in": ["paid"] }  // optional: show only when record.status ∈ {paid}
}
```

- `template` is a path **inside the skill dir** (host reads it path-safely).
  Write the action's instructions there in plain English; the host prepends the
  record JSON as sanitized, passive data and hands the whole thing to the role.
- `when` is both the visibility rule **and** the authorization rule — the host
  re-checks it server-side, so a button gated on `status: paid` can't be invoked
  for a draft. Omit `when` ⇒ always shown.
- You do **not** trigger actions yourself; point the user at the button.

### Completion tracking (bell notifications)

Declare `completionField` + `completionDoneValues` at the top level of the
schema to wire a record's lifecycle into the bell:

```json
{
  "title": "Todos",
  "icon": "check_circle",
  "dataPath": "data/todos/items",
  "primaryKey": "id",
  "fields": {
    "id":     { "type": "string", "label": "ID", "primary": true, "required": true },
    "title":  { "type": "string", "label": "Title", "required": true },
    "status": { "type": "enum", "values": ["Todo", "Doing", "Done"], "label": "Status", "required": true }
  },
  "completionField": "status",
  "completionDoneValues": ["Done"],
  "displayField": "title"
}
```

Behaviour:

- **On create** the host fires a bell notification (titled
  `<schema.title>: <label>`, where `<label>` is the record's `displayField`
  value when declared — falling back to the primaryKey `<id>` otherwise;
  click-navigates to `/collections/<slug>?selected=<id>` so the item's detail
  opens) — unless the new record is **born done** (its `completionField` value
  is already in `completionDoneValues`), in which case nothing fires. The entry
  is published with `lifecycle: "action"` so it persists prominently in the
  bell until the obligation resolves.
- **On update** the host clears the notification when `completionField`
  transitions **into** a done value. Un-completing (Done → Todo) does NOT
  re-fire; firing is bound to create, by design.
- **On delete** the host clears any matching notification so a removed record
  can't leak a stale entry.

The pair is bundled — declaring one without the other fails schema validation.
`completionField` must name a real field; a typo is rejected at load. Works
with any field type whose stringified value is comparable (`enum`, `string`,
`boolean`, …) — e.g. `completionField: "status"` + `completionDoneValues:
["paid", "void"]` on an invoice, or `completionField: "shipped"` +
`completionDoneValues: ["true"]` on an order.

Set `displayField` to make the bell title readable: with `displayField:
"title"` the notification reads `Todos: Buy milk` instead of `Todos: t-0042`.
It must name a real field; an empty value on a given record falls back to the
primaryKey for that record.

> **Building a todo / task list?** When your `completionField` is a status enum,
> also add a `toggle` field (the row/card "done" checkbox) and `notifyWhen`
> (fire the bell only for high-priority items, not every record). See the full
> recipe in **"Worked example: a Todo list"** below — that's the canonical
> template; don't reinvent it from these fragments.

### Time-gated bells (`triggerField`)

By default the completion bell fires **on create**. Add `triggerField` — the
name of a `date` field — to instead **hold the bell until that date arrives**.
The item is still tracked, but its bell stays silent while the trigger date is
in the future and appears once the clock reaches it (compared at day
granularity in the server's local timezone). It clears the same way as any
completion bell — when `completionField` reaches a `completionDoneValues` value.

```json
{
  "title": "Reminders",
  "icon": "event",
  "dataPath": "data/reminders/items",
  "primaryKey": "id",
  "fields": {
    "id":     { "type": "string", "label": "ID", "primary": true, "required": true },
    "what":   { "type": "string", "label": "What", "required": true },
    "dueOn":  { "type": "date",   "label": "Remind on", "required": true },
    "status": { "type": "enum", "values": ["pending", "done"], "label": "Status", "required": true }
  },
  "completionField": "status",
  "completionDoneValues": ["done"],
  "displayField": "what",
  "triggerField": "dueOn"
}
```

This is the "nudge me about this on date X, until I mark it done" pattern. Notes:

- `triggerField` **requires** the completion pair (validation rejects it
  otherwise — there'd be no bell to gate or clear).
- The named field must be type `date`; its value is parsed as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Firing is **derived from the clock, not stored** — so if the server was down
  when the date passed, the bell simply appears at the next boot/check. Pushing
  the date back into the future retracts a bell that already fired.
- Granularity is whole days (no time-of-day).

#### Lead time — fire it early (`triggerLeadDays`)

Keep `triggerField` as the **real** due date and add `triggerLeadDays` to fire
the bell some days ahead of it. "Remind me 10 days before rent is due":

```json
"triggerField": "dueOn",
"triggerLeadDays": 10
```

The bell now appears once the clock reaches `dueOn − 10 days`, and still clears
when the item is marked done. The lead is applied at fire time (not stored), so
it **composes with `spawn`**: every recurred month fires 10 days before its own
`dueOn`, with no extra bookkeeping. It's a non-negative whole number of days and
requires `triggerField`. This is a single earlier bell — not an escalating
multi-stage reminder (info → warning → urgent), which is intentionally out of
scope for collections.

### Recurring obligations (`spawn`)

Add a `spawn` block to make a collection **recur**: when a record satisfies a
predicate (by default, when it becomes "done"), the host automatically creates
the **next** record with its `triggerField` advanced. Combined with
`triggerField`, this expresses periodic obligations — rent, subscriptions,
renewals, recurring payments — with no work from you per cycle: mark this
month's rent `paid`, and next month's pending record appears on its own.

```json
"triggerField": "dueOn",
"spawn": {
  "when":  { "field": "status", "in": ["paid"] },
  "every": { "unit": "month", "interval": 1, "dayOfMonth": 10 },
  "carry": ["amount", "payee"],
  "set":   { "status": "pending" }
}
```

- **`when`** — a `{ field, in: [...] }` predicate (same shape as field/action
  `when`) that fires the spawn. Omit it to default to "the completion-done
  condition" (i.e. spawn when this record is done).
- **`every`** — how to advance `triggerField` from this record to the next:
  - `unit`: `day` · `week` · `month` · `year`; `interval`: a positive integer
    (so `unit: "month", interval: 3` = quarterly, `unit: "year", interval: 1`
    = annual).
  - `dayOfMonth` (month/year only): the **canonical** day-of-month anchor
    (1–31, or `"last"` for the month's last day). Use it for day ≥ 29 so
    short months don't cause drift — "31st of every month" yields
    31 → 28/29 → 31 → 30 … correctly. Omit it for days ≤ 28 and the source
    date's day is preserved.
- **`carry`** — record fields copied verbatim onto the successor (must name
  real fields). Fields not in `carry` / `set` / the trigger+primary keys start
  blank.
- **`set`** — fields forced to fixed values on the successor (typically
  resetting the status to its pending value).

How it behaves (worth understanding so it doesn't surprise you):

- The successor's id is **deterministic**: `<stem>-<YYYYMMDD>` (the source id
  with any trailing `-YYYYMMDD` replaced). So `rent` → `rent-20260610` →
  `rent-20260710`. Creation is **create-if-absent** — it never overwrites, so
  re-running is harmless and any edits you make to a successor are preserved.
- **Forward-only**: un-doing the source (e.g. `paid` → `pending`) does NOT
  delete an already-created successor. And because spawning is convergent,
  deleting the successor while the source still matches `when` will **re-create
  it**. To genuinely **stop a recurrence**, move the source to a status that is
  *not* in `spawn.when` (e.g. an `archived` value) — that's the supported "end
  it" gesture.
- `spawn` **requires** `triggerField` (the successor's date is `triggerField`
  advanced by `every`).

This covers *periodic* obligations. It does **not** do escalating, multi-stage
reminders over a long prep window (info → warning → urgent) — that is
intentionally out of scope for collections.

### Calendar view

Any collection that has at least one `date` field gains a **table ↔ calendar**
toggle in its header — **zero config**. The calendar is a month grid where each
record lands on the day cell matching its date; clicking a record opens the same
detail/edit panel the table uses, and clicking an empty cell starts a new record
with that day prefilled.

```json
{
  "title": "Events",
  "icon": "event",
  "dataPath": "data/events/items",
  "primaryKey": "id",
  "fields": {
    "id":    { "type": "string", "label": "ID", "primary": true, "required": true },
    "name":  { "type": "string", "label": "Name", "required": true },
    "on":    { "type": "date",   "label": "Date", "required": true },
    "until": { "type": "date",   "label": "End" }
  },
  "displayField": "name",
  "calendarField": "on",
  "calendarEndField": "until"
}
```

Notes:

- **No schema change is needed to get the toggle** — it appears whenever a `date`
  field exists. The two keys only *tune* it: `calendarField` pins which date
  anchors the grid (otherwise the first `date` field is used, and the user can
  switch in-view when there are several); `calendarEndField` makes a record span
  multiple days (`calendarField` → `calendarEndField`, inclusive).
- `displayField` sets the chip label (falls back to the primary key).
- **Day granularity only** — collections store `date` (no time-of-day), so the
  calendar is a month grid, not a day/week time-grid.
- Records whose anchor date is missing or unparseable are listed in a small
  "No date" tray under the grid — never silently dropped.
- The calendar is purely a **rendering** of the records: it adds no storage and
  fires nothing. It composes with `triggerField` / `spawn` (which drive bells and
  recurrence) but is independent of them.
- This is the collection-native calendar — the way to give the user a
  calendar of dated records. (The old standalone Calendar view +
  `manageCalendar` tool were removed; `calendarField` is its replacement.)

### Kanban view

Any collection that has at least one `enum` field gains a **Kanban board** toggle
in its header — **zero config**. The board renders one column per declared enum
value (in `values` order), plus a trailing **Uncategorized** column for
empty/unknown values (omitted when the group enum is `required`). Dragging a card
between columns writes that enum field; clicking a card opens the same
detail/edit panel.

```json
{
  "title": "Tasks",
  "icon": "checklist",
  "dataPath": "data/tasks/items",
  "primaryKey": "id",
  "fields": {
    "id":     { "type": "string", "label": "ID", "primary": true, "required": true },
    "title":  { "type": "string", "label": "Title", "required": true },
    "status": { "type": "enum",   "label": "Status", "values": ["Backlog", "Todo", "In Progress", "Done"] },
    "done":   { "type": "toggle", "label": "Done", "field": "status", "onValue": "Done", "offValue": "Todo" }
  },
  "displayField": "title",
  "kanbanField": "status"
}
```

Notes:

- **No schema change is needed to get the toggle** — it appears whenever an
  `enum` field exists. `kanbanField` only *tunes* which enum groups the board
  (otherwise the first `enum` field is used, switchable in-view).
- **The enum is the single source of truth.** For a todo-style "done" checkbox,
  use a `toggle` field projecting the status enum (above) — do NOT add a separate
  stored boolean. Checking the box sets `status` to the done value (and moves the
  card to that column); dragging the card to the Done column checks the box. They
  are the same write.
- Columns are not draggable (order comes from the enum's `values`) and there is
  no manual ordering within a column — a drop only changes the enum value.
- Like the calendar, the board is purely a **rendering** of the records: it adds
  no storage. `completionField` / `completionDoneValues` (bells) are independent
  but pair naturally with the Done column.
- **Building a todo / task list?** Read `config/helps/todo-collection.md` — the
  complete, copy-pasteable recipe (status enum + `done` toggle + priority bells +
  calendar) plus the legacy-`todo-plugin` migration steps.

### Worked example: a Todo list

The full todo recipe — complete `schema.json`, `SKILL.md`, a sample record, and
the legacy-`todo-plugin` migration steps — has its own file:
**`config/helps/todo-collection.md`**. Read it whenever you create or migrate a
todo / task list; it's the canonical template, so copy it rather than assembling
one from the fragments above. The one rule to remember: the `status` enum is the
single source of truth and the "done" checkbox is a `toggle` field projecting it
— **omit the toggle and the list has no checkbox.**

## Records — one JSON object per file

- Write each record to `<dataPath>/<id>.json` via the **Write** tool; the `id`
  field's value is the filename (no extension).
- **List the directory first** and pick a fresh id rather than silently
  overwriting. Update = Read, merge, Write back (preserve fields you weren't
  asked to change). Delete = remove the file.
- **Never write `derived` fields**, and never write an `embed` field — both are
  display-only / host-computed.
- Leave optional fields out of the JSON entirely rather than writing empty
  strings.
- For a `ref` field, write the raw target slug, and make sure that record
  actually exists in the target collection — an invalid slug renders as a broken
  link. The host enforces structure and safety; **you own semantic correctness**
  (valid refs, sane values).

## End-to-end: creating a new collection skill

1. Pick a `<slug>` (lowercase-hyphen, no `mc-` prefix) and a `dataPath`
   (`data/<name>/items`).
2. Write `data/skills/<slug>/schema.json` — `title`, `icon`, `dataPath`,
   `primaryKey` (with the matching field flagged `primary: true`), and the
   `fields` map in the order you want columns. Add `actions` +
   `data/skills/<slug>/templates/*.md` only if the collection needs delegated
   behaviour. (The bridge mirrors these into `.claude/skills/<slug>/`.)
3. Write `data/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` — front-matter `name` + `description`,
   then the record-shape bullets and CRUD conventions.
4. Tell the user it's ready at `/collections/<slug>`. The bridge mirrors the
   files and triggers a re-scan, so the host discovers it without a restart and
   with no host code. If it doesn't appear: first confirm you wrote under
   `data/skills/<slug>/` (NOT `.claude/skills/…`, which is gated and won't
   mirror); then check your `schema.json` passed validation — primary key
   flagged `primary: true`, `ref`/`embed` have a valid `to`, `enum` has
   `values`, `table` has `of`, `derived` has `formula`, action ids unique,
   `dataPath` under the workspace, `triggerField` names a real `date` field and
   has the completion pair, `spawn` has `triggerField` and a valid `every`,
   `calendarField` / `calendarEndField` name real `date` fields (and
   `calendarEndField` requires `calendarField`), `kanbanField` names a real
   `enum` field, any `toggle` field names a real `enum` `field` with its
   `onValue` / `offValue` among that enum's `values`, and `notifyWhen` (if set)
   requires `completionField` and names a real field.
   (A schema that fails validation is logged server-side and silently skipped
   at discovery.)

## Worked reference: the billing suite

The billing collections are the canonical examples. They ship as **recipes**
(copy-paste schemas + SKILL bodies), not as boot-overwritten presets — read the
recipe when the user wants any of them, and copy the schema verbatim:

- **`config/helps/billing-clients-worklog.md`** (Bundle A):
  - **`clients`** — flat table (`string` / `email` / `text` / `markdown`). The
    simplest possible collection; everything else `ref`s into it.
  - **`worklog`** — adds a `ref` (`clientId → clients`), a `date`, a `number`, a
    `boolean`. A companion data source.
- **`config/helps/billing-invoice.md`** (Bundle B):
  - **`profile`** — a `singleton` (one record, id `me`): the issuer identity.
  - **`invoice`** — the full toolkit in one schema: an `embed` issuer
    (`profile/me`), a `ref` client (`clients`), a `table` of line items, three
    `derived` money fields, an `enum` status, and four `actions` (PDF always-on;
    sale / payment / void gated by `status` via `when`).
