// Schema-driven app types. An "app" is a skill (under
// .claude/skills/<slug>/) that also ships a sibling `schema.json`.
// The host's CollectionView reads the schema + records and renders a
// table/form; Claude reads SKILL.md and CRUDs the records as JSON
// files.
//
// Field types for v0 — keep this list narrow and grow it only when a
// real app needs the new type. v0 supports flat records only; nested
// tables / cross-collection refs / derived fields / actions are
// deferred to follow-ups (see plans/feat-skill-driven-apps.md).
