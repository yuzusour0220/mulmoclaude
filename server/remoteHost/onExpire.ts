// onExpire cleanup for the remote-host runner (plans/feat-remote-offline-queue.md).
//
// When the shared runner drops a command for being past its `expiresAt`, it calls
// this BEFORE deleting the command doc so an expired `startChat` leaves nothing
// behind: we delete the full-res attachment bytes the remote staged in Firebase
// Storage for it (`users/{uid}/uploads/{storage_id}`). The Storage lifecycle TTL
// is only the last-resort backstop for the one case this can't cover — a host
// that never reconnects at all.
//
// `uid` is the runner's session uid, passed in by the runner (channel.uid) rather
// than read from a global — a concurrent reconnect as a different account must not
// point this cleanup at the new user's Storage path.
//
// Best-effort throughout: a failed delete logs and leaves the orphan for the TTL
// sweep, and this must never throw back into the runner (the doc deletion runs
// regardless). Unlike startChat's strict `readStorageIds`, extraction here is
// lenient — this is cleanup, so a malformed entry is skipped, not surfaced.
