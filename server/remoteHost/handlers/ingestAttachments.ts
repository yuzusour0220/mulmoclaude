// Attachment ingest for remote chat (plans/feat-remote-chat-image-attachments.md).
//
// The phone can't carry full-res attachment bytes over the Firestore command
// channel (a command doc caps at ~1 MiB), so it uploads each file — photo,
// video, or PDF — to Firebase Storage at `users/{uid}/uploads/{storage_id}` and
// sends only the `storage_id` on startChat. This module — signed in as the same
// user — pulls each staged object, persists it into the workspace attachment
// store via `saveAttachment` (so it lands in `data/attachments/YYYY/MM/`, gets a
// correct mime, and is accepted by the same attachment pipeline Vue uploads
// use), deletes the Storage object (staging only), and returns a path-only
// `Attachment` per file for startChat to hand to the spawned chat.
//
// Factory (createIngestAttachments) keeps the flow unit-testable with the
// Storage + attachment-store deps stubbed; the default export wires the real ones.
