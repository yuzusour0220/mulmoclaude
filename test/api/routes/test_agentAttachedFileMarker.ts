// Unit tests for `withAttachedFileMarker`. Pins the multi-attachment
// behaviour: a user message with N path-bearing attachments must get
// N `[Attached file: …]` lines so the LLM can pass every path to
// path-taking tools (e.g. editImages.imagePaths). Codex flagged a
// regression on PR #1050 where only the first path leaked through —
// breaking "paste one image + select another → combine these"
// flows. This test guards against a re-occurrence.
