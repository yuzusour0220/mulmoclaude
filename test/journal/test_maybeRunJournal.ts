// Coverage for two of the three feature gates inside `maybeRunJournal`:
// the ENOENT-disable latch and the `force` flag that bypasses the
// interval check (#799 PR4).
//
// The third gate — the in-process lock — is intentionally NOT covered
// here. Exercising it deterministically requires holding the first
// call mid-flight while a second runs, which means leaving an
// unresolved Promise around the module-level `running` flag. Any
// failure path before the explicit release leaks `running = true`
// into sibling tests and corrupts their state. The lock itself is
// trivially correct (one synchronous boolean check at the top of
// `maybeRunJournal`); leaving it to manual inspection beats
// flake-prone unit coverage.
