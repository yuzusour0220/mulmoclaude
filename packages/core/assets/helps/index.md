# About MulmoClaude

MulmoClaude is a GUI front-end for Claude Code. It lets you talk to Claude Code through a chat interface with rich visual output, powered by the **GUI Chat Protocol** — a plugin layer that allows Claude to render structured results (documents, spreadsheets, mind maps, images, and more) directly in the canvas alongside the conversation.

Under the hood it uses the Claude Code Agent SDK as its LLM core. Claude has full access to your workspace files and can use built-in tools (read, write, bash, search) as well as GUI Chat Protocol plugins registered as MCP servers.

**Core philosophy**: The workspace is the database. Files are the source of truth. Claude is the intelligent interface.

## Roles

- **General** — Everyday assistant: task management, scheduling, wiki, mind maps, and general Q&A.
- **Office** — Creates documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and MulmoScript slideshows.
- **Guide & Planner** — Collects your needs via a form, then produces a rich illustrated guide or plan. Works for recipes, travel itineraries, fitness programs, event planning, study guides, DIY projects, and more.
- **Artist** — Generates and edits images, opens a drawing canvas, and creates 3D scenes.
- **Tutor** — Assesses your knowledge level, then teaches any topic with structured documents and visuals.
- **Storyteller** — Crafts illustrated narrative stories as a MulmoScript storyboard.
- **Storyteller Plus** — Like Storyteller, with consistent character images across beats.
- **Settings** — Manages information sources, skills, and scheduled automations for the workspace.
- _(Additional roles may be defined by the user in the workspace.)_

## Key Capabilities

## Collections — Apps from Data

Collections are MulmoClaude's most distinctive capability: a **schema-driven data app declared in a single small JSON file**, with no database, ORM, or migration tool. You describe a data model, cross-record relations, computed fields, and per-record action buttons in a `schema.json`; the host reads that DSL and renders a full app — table, calendar, kanban board, and dashboard views — over a folder of plain `<id>.json` records. The same primitives power todo lists, recipe boxes, stock portfolios, invoice ledgers, vocabulary decks, and curricula, all without any app-specific host code. This is the core philosophy made concrete: a `schema.json` plus a folder of records **is** the app.

Because Claude authors and edits the schema for you in conversation, you build and reshape these apps just by talking — "add a priority field," "track this as a kanban," "make rent recur monthly" — and the collection updates live. We call this **vibe crafting**: the end-user counterpart of a developer's "vibe coding" — you describe the app you want and Claude builds it, with the schema validated and custom views sandboxed so you get the power without the pitfalls. Records stay validated, computed fields (totals, cross-collection lookups) recompute on every render, and completion bells / recurring obligations are declared in the same schema.

See [Collection skills](config/helps/collection-skills.md) for the full schema DSL.

## Custom Views — Views the Built-ins Don't Cover

When the built-in table / calendar / kanban / dashboard views don't fit what you want to _see_ — a year-at-a-glance planner, a Gantt bar, a heat-map, a printable report — Claude authors a **custom view**: a single HTML file rendered in a sandboxed iframe over the collection's records. It reads (and optionally writes) records through a scoped token, stays live as the data changes, and can hand work back to a chat — all without any view-specific host code. The view is data, just like the rest of the collection, so you can ask for an entirely new way to look at your data in plain language and get it.

See [Custom views](config/helps/custom-view.md) for the authoring contract.

## Wiki — Long-Term Memory

The wiki (`wiki/` in the workspace) acts as Claude's long-term memory. Unlike the conversation history which resets each session, the wiki is a persistent, compounding knowledge base that Claude builds and maintains over time. You feed it sources — articles, URLs, notes — and Claude ingests them into structured, interlinked Markdown pages. The more you add, the smarter it gets.

See [Wiki](config/helps/wiki.md) for details on how it works.

## Help Pages

- [Sandbox](config/helps/sandbox.md) — how the Docker sandbox isolates the agent, what it can access, and how to disable it
- [Error recovery](config/helps/error-recovery.md) — the lookup the agent reads on tool failures (gh/git/SSH inside the sandbox, Marp PDF, registry import, build/workspace, plugin runtime) before asking the user
