# Custom collection views (LLM-authored HTML)

A **custom view** is an HTML file you write that renders a collection's records
however the user wants — a year-at-a-glance planner, a Gantt bar, a heat-map,
a printable report. The host renders it in a sandboxed iframe over the
collection's data. The user asks for it in plain language ("give me a view that
shows my whole year"); you author the HTML and register it.

Read `config/helps/collection-skills.md` first for the collection/schema DSL.
This file is only about the **view** layer.

## Where the files go

```text
data/skills/<slug>/
  schema.json          ← register the view here, under `views[]`
  views/
    <name>.html        ← the view you author (Write/Edit)
```

**Feed collections** keep their skill files under `feeds/<slug>/` instead of
`data/skills/<slug>/`, so author a feed's view at `feeds/<slug>/views/<name>.html`
and register it in `feeds/<slug>/schema.json`. Everything else below — the
`views[]` entry shape, the runtime contract, the sandbox rules — is identical.

The HTML lives under `views/` and must end in `.html`. Register each view in
the collection's `schema.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "title": "Annual Plan",
  "icon": "calendar_month",
  "dataPath": "data/annual-plan/items",
  "primaryKey": "id",
  "fields": {
    /* … */
  },
  "views": [
    { "id": "year", "label": "Year", "icon": "grid_view", "file": "views/year.html", "capabilities": ["read"] },
    { "id": "planner", "label": "Planner", "icon": "edit_calendar", "file": "views/planner.html", "capabilities": ["read", "write"] },
  ],
}
```

- **`id`** — a slug (letters/digits/`-`/`_`). The selector shows one button per view.
- **`label`** — the button text (author it; it is not run through translation).
- **`icon`** — optional Material Symbols icon name.
- **`file`** — `views/<name>.html`, path-safe.
- **`capabilities`** — least privilege. `["read"]` (default) for a view that
  only displays data; `["read","write"]` only if the view edits records.

After you Write the HTML and register it, the view's button appears in the
collection's view-mode selector automatically.

## The runtime contract — `window.__MC_VIEW`

The host injects a bootstrap into your page **before any of your scripts run**:

```js
window.__MC_VIEW = {
  slug: "annual-plan", // this collection
  token: "<scoped capability token>", // Authorization bearer
  dataUrl: "http://localhost:3001/api/collections/annual-plan/view-data",
  onChange: (cb) => unsubscribe, // live refresh — see "Staying live" below
  openItem: (id, mode) => void, // open a record in the host's panel — see "Opening a record"
  startChat: (prompt, role) => void, // draft a new chat for the user — see "Starting a chat"
};
```

### Reading records

> **Always project `fields`.** The host refuses any read of more than 200
> records that does not pass `?fields=…` or `?ids=…`, because an unscoped
> fetch wastes work and bandwidth on columns your view never reads. Once a
> user's collection grows past the threshold an unprojected view starts
> returning `400` instead of records — write the projection from day one so
> the same view keeps working forever.

```js
const { token, dataUrl } = window.__MC_VIEW;
// List the columns this view actually reads — never send `dataUrl` raw.
const url = dataUrl + "?fields=" + encodeURIComponent("title,start,end,status");
const res = await fetch(url, { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + token } });
if (!res.ok) {
  // Surface the server's reason (the 400 carries `{ error: "<message>" }`),
  // not just the status code — that text is what tells the user / Claude
  // how to fix the call (e.g. "pass `fields` to project only the columns").
  const detail = await res.text();
  throw new Error("load failed (" + res.status + "): " + detail);
}
const { items } = await res.json(); // { collection, count, items: [...] }
```

Records come back **with computed fields already resolved** (derived formulas,
toggles, embeds) — the same numbers the user sees elsewhere.

- **`?fields=a,b,c`** — only these columns per record (the primary key is always
  included). Use this on every read; it is mandatory above 200 records.
- **`?ids=x,y,z`** — only these specific record ids. Use it when the view edits
  / shows one record at a time. Combinable with `fields`.
- The primary key is always returned regardless of `fields`.

### Writing records (only with the `write` capability)

```js
const res = await fetch(dataUrl, {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + token, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ items: [{ id: "task-3", start: "2026-07-01" }], mode: "merge" }),
});
const { written, rejected } = await res.json(); // fix & re-send any rejected rows
```

- `mode`: `"merge"` (update only the fields you send — use this for edits),
  `"upsert"` (replace the whole record), `"create"` (fail if the id exists).
- Each row must carry the collection's `primaryKey`.
- **Never** send computed fields (`derived` / `toggle` / `embed`) — they are
  rejected. Write the underlying enum for a toggle.
- **There is no delete** from a view. A view can never do more than the agent's
  own data tools.

Surface any `rejected` rows to the user with their `problem` text — don't fail
silently.

### Staying live — `onChange`

By default a view paints once, on load. To keep it fresh, register a callback —
it runs whenever the collection's data changes on the server:

```js
// Same projection rule as the initial read — list the columns this view uses.
const url = dataUrl + "?fields=" + encodeURIComponent("title,start,end,status");
async function render() {
  const res = await fetch(url, { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + token } });
  if (!res.ok) return; // surface the body if you want a richer error UI
  const { items } = await res.json();
  // …draw items…
}
render(); // initial paint
window.__MC_VIEW.onChange(render); // live refresh on every server-side change
```

What you need to know:

- **It fires for every writer** — the assistant adding/editing a record in chat,
  an edit from another browser tab, a feed refresh, and auto-generated recurring
  records. Your view stays in sync no matter who changed the data.
- **Make the callback a full re-fetch + re-render** (like `render` above). It is
  a "something changed, reload" signal — it carries no record data — and one
  callback may stand in for several rapid changes.
- **It is already debounced** (a burst of changes collapses to one call) — do
  **not** add your own throttle.
- **No extra capability needed** — a read-only view can use `onChange`.
- It returns an **unsubscribe** function; you rarely need it (the view is torn
  down with the iframe), but it's there for fine-grained control.

### Opening a record — `openItem`

Your view owns the _layout_ (a grid, a chart, a board); it doesn't have to
rebuild a form to view or edit one record. Call `openItem` to hand a record to
the host's own panel — the same detail/edit modal the user gets clicking a row
in the table view — centred over your view:

```js
window.__MC_VIEW.openItem("task-3"); // read-only detail (default)
window.__MC_VIEW.openItem("task-3", "edit"); // jump straight into the editor
```

- **`id`** — the record's `primaryKey` value. If it isn't a loaded record,
  nothing happens (fire-and-forget; returns nothing).
- **`mode`** — `"view"` (default) opens read-only detail with the panel's own
  Edit button; `"edit"` opens the editor directly.
- **No `write` capability required — even for `"edit"`.** Opening the host's
  panel is a _user_ action in the host's trusted UI: the user still has to press
  Save, and the write goes through the host, not your scoped token. So a
  `["read"]` view can offer a full "edit this record" affordance without
  widening its own capabilities. (Capabilities gate what your view's _code_ may
  do to the data; they don't restrict what the user may do through the host.)
- **Pair it with `onChange`.** After the user saves in the panel, your
  `onChange` callback fires (the data changed), so a live view repaints itself —
  no extra wiring needed.

This is the right tool whenever a record's full detail is richer than your
view's summary, or whenever the user wants to edit but you don't want a
`write`-capable view doing its own PUTs.

### Starting a chat — `startChat`

Your view can't reach external services or run a skill on its own (the sandbox
blocks it). Instead, hand the work to a chat: `startChat` opens a **new chat
session with your prompt prefilled in the composer** — as an editable draft. It
does **not** send. The user reads it, edits if they want, and presses Send (or
clears it). The agent in that approved chat does the real work — file a GitHub
issue and write the URL back, fetch a link's title/image and save them, or just
start from a task record.

```js
const task = items.find((r) => r.id === id);
window.__MC_VIEW.startChat(`Create a GitHub issue for this task and write the URL back to record ${id}:\n\n` + `Title: ${task.title}\n${task.body}`);
```

- **`prompt`** — the seed text. Empty / whitespace-only is ignored (no empty
  chat). Build it from your records — that's the whole point.
- **`role`** _(optional second argument)_ — a built-in role id to preselect for
  the new session (e.g. `"office"`, `"investor"`); validated by the host. Omit it
  and the chat opens in **General** — which is what you usually want.
- **No capability required.** Your view's code only _proposes text into an input
  field_ — nothing is created, fetched, or written until the **user** presses
  Send, at which point it's an ordinary agent run they authored. So a `["read"]`
  view can offer "start work on this" buttons freely.
- **Pair it with `onChange`.** When the chat's agent later writes back to a
  record, your `onChange` callback fires and a live view repaints.

Use this — not a hidden flag the user has to reconcile later — whenever a button
should _start backend work_: the user stays in the loop through trusted first-
party UI, and the action runs as a normal, visible, cancellable agent turn.

## Sandbox rules (what the view may and may not do)

The view runs in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe with a strict CSP:

- **Inline `<script>` and `<style>` only.** External scripts/styles/fonts must
  come from the allowed CDNs: `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`,
  `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`,
  `cdn.plot.ly` — so charting libraries (Chart.js, Plotly, D3) load fine from
  those CDNs. No other external hosts.
- **`<img>` may load from any `https:` host** (plus `data:` / `blob:`), so an
  image URL stored in a record — a feed's article thumbnail, a poster, an
  avatar — renders directly. (Images are the one resource type not pinned to the
  CDN allowlist; everything else above still is.)
- **`<audio>` / `<video>` may load from any `https:` host** (plus the origin and
  `data:` / `blob:`), so a record's media URL — a podcast feed's `.mp3`, a
  video enclosure — plays directly.
- **`fetch` (and XHR / WebSocket / `sendBeacon`) is allowed ONLY to
  `window.__MC_VIEW.dataUrl`'s origin.** All other origins are blocked — no
  phone-home, no third-party analytics, no fetching weather / prices / etc.
  directly from the view. If the user needs external data, put it in a (feed)
  collection and read it through `dataUrl`. (This is the channel that actually
  matters for keeping the scoped token and records from leaking off-box.) When a
  button should _do_ outside work — file an issue, fetch a link's metadata, run a
  skill — don't try to reach out from view code; use **`startChat`** (above) to
  hand the task to a user-approved chat.
- No access to cookies, `localStorage`, or the parent page — the iframe has an
  opaque origin. The token is the only credential, and it is scoped to this one
  collection.
- **Opening external links is allowed** — use `<a href="…" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">` (or `window.open(url, "_blank")`) to open a record's URL in a
  new browser tab, e.g. a feed card linking to its article. The link opens as a
  normal tab. (A plain same-tab `<a href>` would try to navigate the sandboxed
  frame itself and is blocked, so always use `target="_blank"` for outbound
  links.)
- Build a full HTML document with a `<head>` (the host injects its bootstrap at
  the start of `<head>`).

## Editing / iterating

To change a view later, just Read and Edit its `views/<name>.html` file under the
collection's skill dir (`data/skills/<slug>/` — or `feeds/<slug>/` for a feed);
its path is in the schema's `views[]`. To remove one, delete the file and its
`views[]` entry — or use the collection's settings gear (the per-collection
config modal) in the UI, which does both for you.

## Example 1 — Year overview (read-only)

A 12-month grid that plots each record on its start month. Schema has `date`
fields `start` / `end` and a `title`. `capabilities: ["read"]`.
