// Declarative retrieval config for the "Feeds" mechanism. A Feed is a

// a skill) under `<workspace>/feeds/<slug>/schema.json`. The host's
// retrieval engine reads it to periodically refill the collection's
// records via the shared collections io layer.
//
// The ingest vocab (INGEST_KINDS / FEED_SCHEDULES + their literal-union types)
// lives in the sibling `../collection` subpath alongside the schema contract, so
// the package's schema validator can enforce it. Re-exported here so the feeds
// engine's existing importers resolve them unchanged.

// Two flavours: the declarative kinds (`rss`/`atom`/`http-json`) fetch-and-map,
// and `agent` dispatches a hidden worker. The `code` kind (LLM-generated
// deterministic transform) is still reserved for a future retriever.

// The agent ingest kind. Defined HERE (not imported from `../collection`) on
// purpose: the engine only needs the literal to branch, and re-importing it as a
// VALUE keeps this module free of a value dependency on the collection vocab.
// Core owns its own copy for the schema validator; this matches the same literal.
