// Agent-performed ingest (`ingest.kind: "agent"`). On schedule (or a manual
// Refresh), the host seeds a hidden background worker — origin `system`, so
// it never appears in the user's session list — in the collection's declared
// role with its template + a summary of every record, and the worker edits the
// records itself via the collections io layer. The host stays domain-free:
// everything stock-specific (or whatever the collection does) is prose in the
// template.
//
// DI seam: the worker is launched through `FeedsHost.spawnWorker`, injected at
// boot via `configureFeedsHost`, not imported directly — this module ships in a
// shared package and must not reach into any host's session/routes layer.
