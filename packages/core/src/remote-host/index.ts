// host (MulmoClaude, MulmoTerminal) and the remote/mobile client (mulmoserver).
//
// A host signs in to Firebase as the user, listens to that user's per-host
// command queue in Firestore, runs a handler, and writes the result back; the
// remote writes commands and reads results via a real-time listener. This module
// owns the wire types + the Firestore path helpers. It is the single source of
// truth so the host runner and the client never drift on the protocol.
//
// Ported from ../mulmoserver/src/firestore/commandChannel.ts and the per-host
// copy that lived in MulmoClaude's server/remoteHost/. The one change vs. those
// copies: the path helpers take the `firestore` instance as a parameter (rather
// than importing a module-level singleton) so a single extracted module serves
// every host's own Firebase init. The hostId is host-specific ("mulmoclaude",
// "mulmoterminal") and is supplied by each host — there is no discovery.
