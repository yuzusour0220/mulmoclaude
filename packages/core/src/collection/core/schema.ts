// Schema-driven collection types. A "collection" is a skill (under
// .claude/skills/<slug>/) that also ships a sibling `schema.json`.
// The host's <CollectionView> reads the schema + records and renders
// a table/form; Claude reads SKILL.md and CRUDs the records as JSON
// files.
//
// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: every type describing the schema.json contract is
// derived (`z.infer`) from the zod definitions in `./schemaZ` — the shapes,
// their doc comments, and the validation rules live THERE; this module only
// re-derives the TypeScript names consumers import. The imports from
// `./schemaZ` are type-only, so zod never reaches the browser bundle through
// the isomorphic barrel; at runtime the dependency points the other way
// (schemaZ imports this module's consts).
//
// Field specs are a DISCRIMINATED UNION on `type`: narrow with
// `field.type === "enum"` (etc.) before reading a variant key like `values`,
// `to`, `formula`, or `of`.
