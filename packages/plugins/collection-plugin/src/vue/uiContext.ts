// Host-provided UI capabilities the collection view layer needs but a package
// can't own: data fetching over the host's collection REST API, and the host's
// asset-URL scheme. Each host (MulmoClaude, MulmoTerminal) configures this once
// at app startup via `configureCollectionUi`; the view layer reads it through
// `collectionUi()`. Mirrors the server-side `configureCollectionHost` binding.
//
// This grows as more of the View moves into the package (navigation, chat,
// confirm, …); today it's the two capabilities `useCollectionRendering` needs.
