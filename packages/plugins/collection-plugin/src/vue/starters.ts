// Curated "start from a template" collection starters shown in the new-collection
// modal. Each entry's `prompt` is injected into the chat composer as an editable
// draft (the user reviews / sends it); `title` + `description` are the card face.
//
// All three strings are ENGLISH SOURCE — the modal translates them into the user's
// locale at runtime via the host's `/api/translation` route (namespace
// "collection-starters"), the same mechanism the host's role-query chips use.
// These prompts were previously per-role suggestion chips in the host's
// `roles.ts`; they live here now so they surface from the Collections UI
// independent of which role is active. (See plans/feat-collection-starters-modal.md.)
//
// `icon` is a Material Symbols name, matching the collection-card convention.
