// @mulmoclaude/collection-plugin/vue — browser UI layer.
//
// The host frontend imports from here (the UI host binding, the rendering
// composable, and — as they move in — the View components). Configure the host
// binding once at app startup:
//   import { configureCollectionUi } from "@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin/vue";
//   configureCollectionUi({ fetchCollectionDetail, fileAssetUrl });
//
// Importing this entry also pulls the package's compiled Tailwind classes
// (style.css) into the host bundle — node_modules isn't in the host's Tailwind
// content scan, so the package ships its own. Hosts that only use the
// composable API should also `import "@mulmoclaude/collection-plugin/style.css"`.
