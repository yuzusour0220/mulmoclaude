// @mulmoclaude/collection-plugin — isomorphic collection engine.
//
// Pure, framework-free logic shared by the host server (validation /
// derive / notifications) and the host frontend (rendering). Extracted so
// MulmoClaude and MulmoTerminal share one implementation and the server no
// longer reaches into `src/` for it. Vue surfaces will live in `./vue`.
