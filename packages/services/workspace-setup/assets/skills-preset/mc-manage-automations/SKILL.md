# Automations manager

A bundled MulmoClaude preset skill (`mc-` prefix = launcher-managed; do not edit
this file in the workspace, it is overwritten on every server boot).

Help the user schedule recurring agent tasks — the things that wake the agent
up on a cron / interval to run a fixed prompt. State lives in a single JSON
array at `config/scheduler/tasks.json` (cwd-relative; the agent runs with cwd
set to the workspace root, so every path in this file is plain cwd-relative);
the auto-refresh hook re-registers tasks after every Write/Edit so changes
take effect immediately.

End with a one-line confirmation ("Scheduled weather-morning, daily 07:00
UTC." / "Stopped weekly-cleanup.") so the user can verify without scrolling.

## Workflow 1: schedule a new automation

**Triggers**: "毎朝 7 時に天気を", "every weekday 8am check email",
"schedule a weekly cleanup", "1時間ごとに news 確認".

**Step 1 — convert local time to UTC.** Schedules are stored / compared in
UTC (the task-manager calls `Date.getUTCHours/Minutes`). When the user gives
a local time, convert before writing. E.g. "07:00 JST" → `"16:00"` of the
*previous* UTC day? No — `07:00 JST` is `22:00 UTC` of the *previous* day.
JST is UTC+9, so `07:00 JST = 22:00 UTC (yesterday)`. (Run the math, don't
trust your reflex — UTC offsets are a classic typo source.)

**Step 2 — pick a kebab-case id.** Memorable, lowercase, hyphen-separated:
`weather-morning`, `weekly-cleanup`, `hourly-news`.

**Step 3 — Read the existing file** (or create the array if missing):

```bash
config/scheduler/tasks.json
```

It's a single JSON array. Append a new entry:

```json
{
  "id": "weather-morning",
  "name": "Morning weather",
  "description": "Check today's weather every weekday at 7am.",
  "schedule": { "type": "daily", "time": "22:00" },
  "missedRunPolicy": "runOnceImmediately",
  "enabled": true,
  "roleId": "general",
  "prompt": "What's the weather today?",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-11T08:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-11T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Schedule kinds**:

- `{ "type": "daily", "time": "HH:MM" }` — daily at the given **UTC** time.
- `{ "type": "interval", "intervalMs": <ms> }` — every N ms. `60000` =
  1 min, `3600000` = 1 hour, `86400000` = 1 day.

**`missedRunPolicy`**:

- `runOnceImmediately` — if the scheduled time was missed (laptop asleep,
  server down), run once on next wake. Use for status checks ("what's the
  weather", "any new emails").
- `skip` — drop missed runs. Use for news polls (no point catching up).

**Cadence suggestions** (offer these by default unless the user asks for
something specific):

- News polling → **hourly** interval
- Digest reports → **daily** at a fixed local time
- Cleanup tasks → **weekly** (use `interval` of `604800000` ms)
- Calendar / inbox sync → **every 4 hours** (`14400000` ms)

The auto-refresh hook fires on Write/Edit and re-registers tasks, so the new
automation activates immediately.

## Workflow 2: list / browse

**Triggers**: "show my automations", "登録 task 全部", "何が走ってる?".

Read `config/scheduler/tasks.json` and present `name` + `schedule` +
`enabled` for each. Convert the stored UTC `time` back to the
user's local zone when displaying ("daily 07:00 JST" reads better than
"daily 22:00 UTC").

If filtered ("enabled だけ", "daily のだけ"), filter before showing.

## Workflow 3: update

**Triggers**: "weather-morning を 8 時に変更", "disable foo-task", "change
the prompt for bar".

Read the current array, find the entry by `id`, modify the relevant fields,
bump `updatedAt` to the current ISO timestamp, write back. Preserve every
other field unless the user explicitly asked to change it.

To **pause** a task without deleting, set `enabled: false`.

## Workflow 4: remove

**Triggers**: "stop the foo task", "weekly-cleanup 削除".

Only when the user explicitly asks. Read the array, splice the entry by
`id`, write back. Confirm afterward.

If the user is unsure, suggest `enabled: false` as a reversible alternative.

## Tone

Friendly, practical. When suggesting a cadence, lead with what makes sense
("morning weather → daily at your local 7am") rather than asking the user to
pick from `daily` / `interval` / `hourly` cold. If the user phrases a time
naturally ("毎朝"), convert to a concrete UTC value rather than asking back.
