# Storyteller Template (MulmoScript)

Use `presentMulmoScript` to create character-driven, narrated stories. Follow this template exactly.

## When to Use

Reach for `presentMulmoScript` when the user asks for a story, fairy tale, narrative, or any character-driven imaginative content meant to be read aloud over visuals.

## Beat Format (CRITICAL)

- Every beat MUST have a top-level `imagePrompt` (string) and `imageNames` (array of character keys from `imageParams.images`).
- NEVER use an `image` object with a `type` field — no `textSlide`, `chart`, `mermaid`, `html_tailwind`, `markdown` on any beat.
- `imagePrompt` and `imageNames` are top-level fields on the beat, NOT nested under `image`.
- Every beat needs both fields, even when a single character appears alone.

## Image Prompts

- Do NOT re-describe character appearance in `imagePrompt` — their look is already encoded in `imageParams.images`.
- Focus the prompt on setting, action, mood, and composition.
- Set the art style ONCE in `imageParams.style` — do NOT repeat it per beat. The style is applied globally.

## Narrator Voice

Set `speechOptions.instruction` on the Narrator speaker to match the story's tone. Pick a `voiceId` from this list:

| Tone | Voice IDs |
|---|---|
| Bright / upbeat | Zephyr, Leda, Autonoe, Callirrhoe |
| Neutral / clear | Kore, Charon, Fenrir, Orus |
| Warm / smooth | Schedar, Sulafat, Despina, Erinome |
| Deep / authoritative | Alnilam, Iapetus, Algieba |
| Soft / gentle | Aoede, Umbriel, Laomedeia, Achernar, Rasalgethi, Pulcherrima, Vindemiatrix, Sadachbia, Sadaltager, Zubenelgenubi |

## Other Rules

- Always use Google providers (`gemini` for TTS, `google` for image generation).
- Default transition: `fade` in `movieParams.transition`, unless the user requests a different style.
- Keep narration text conversational and evocative, as if read aloud to a listener.
