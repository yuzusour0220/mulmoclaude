# Gemini API Key

MulmoClaude uses Google's Gemini API for image, audio, and video generation. Setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is **technically optional**, but we **strongly recommend** it — a large portion of MulmoClaude's visual and multimedia output depends on it.

A single key unlocks all three capabilities (images, TTS audio, video) — you don't need separate credentials for each.

## What the Key Unlocks

### Images

- **`generateImage`** — creates images from text prompts. The heart of the **Artist** role.
- **`editImages`** — transforms, restyles, or combines up to 8 existing images per call ("convert to Ghibli style", "remove the background", "merge these two photos into one"). Also **Artist**.
- **Inline document images** — roles that produce rich documents (**Guide & Planner**, **Tutor**, Recipe Guide, Trip Planner, …) embed generated images directly into the page via `presentDocument`. Without a key, those image slots fall back to italic "🖼️ Image: &lt;prompt&gt;" text markers — the prompt is preserved, but no picture renders.
- **MulmoScript image beats** — `presentMulmoScript` uses Gemini image models for `imagePrompt` beats. **Storyteller Plus** additionally uses them for consistent-character scenes across a storyboard.

### Audio

- **MulmoScript speech** — `presentMulmoScript` synthesizes speaker voices via Gemini TTS (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`). This is what turns a storyboard into spoken narration, so the **Storyteller** and **Storyteller Plus** roles become near-complete multimedia pieces.

### Video

- **MulmoScript movie beats** — beats whose `image.type` is `moviePrompt` are rendered with Google's **Veo** models (`veo-2.0-generate-001`, `veo-3.0-generate-001`, …). Without a key, movie beats can't be produced.

### Bottom line

Without a Gemini API key:

- The **Artist** role has nothing to generate.
- **Storyteller** and **Storyteller Plus** still produce a storyboard, but without images or narration.
- Rich documents from **Guide & Planner**, **Tutor**, and similar roles render as text-only with placeholder markers where images should be.

## How to Get a Key

The Gemini API has a **free tier that is sufficient for personal use**. Higher-volume or premium-model use (e.g. Veo video) may require a paid plan.

1. Open [Google AI Studio → API keys](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and sign in with a Google account.
2. Click **Create API key**. If prompted, select or create a Google Cloud project (any project will do).
3. Copy the key — it starts with `AIza…`.
4. Open the project's `.env` file in the repository root (copy `.env.example` first if it doesn't exist yet) and add the line:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza…your-key…
   ```

5. Restart MulmoClaude so the new environment variable is picked up.

## Verifying It's Active

The quickest check: switch to the **Artist** role and ask for _"an image of a red panda"_. If a real image appears in the canvas (instead of an italic text marker or a disabled-role hint), the key is wired up correctly.

You can also inspect the server log on startup: messages like `GEMINI_API_KEY not set — image placeholders will render as text markers` indicate the key is missing or misread.

## Security

- The key lives in your local `.env` file. MulmoClaude never uploads it to its own servers or to Anthropic — requests go directly from your machine to Google.
- Treat the key like a password. Anyone who sees it can make billable API calls against your Google account.
- If you suspect a key has leaked, revoke it from [Google AI Studio → API keys](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and generate a new one.
