// @package-contract
//
// This module is designed to be extractable as a standalone npm
// package (e.g. `@mulmoclaude/chat-service`) at any time. To keep
// that path open, the rules are:
//
//  1. NO raw imports from `../` outside this directory — all host
//     dependencies MUST be passed through `ChatServiceDeps`.
//  2. Types declared here are STRUCTURAL duplicates of what the
//     host app uses. They look like the real `Role` / `Logger` /
//     `StartChatParams` types so the same functions plug in, but
//     they are defined here so the package has no compile-time
//     link back to the host.
//  3. When you add a new dependency, extend `ChatServiceDeps` and
//     thread it through the factory functions — do NOT reach out
//     to a module import. See #269 / #305 for the rationale.

/** A file attached to a bridge or UI message. Generic enough for

 *
 *  Either `data` (inline base64 bytes) or `path` (workspace-relative
 *  path the server can read) MUST be set:
 *
 *    - Bridges over the socket transport ship raw bytes, so they
 *      populate `data` (and usually `mimeType`).
 *    - The Vue UI uploads paste/drop and sidebar-pick files to disk
 *      before sending and populates `path`; the server reads bytes
 *      from disk and infers `mimeType` from the extension.
 *
 *  Mirrors `@mulmobridge/protocol`'s `Attachment` (kept structurally
 *  duplicated here per the package-contract rules in this file). */

   *  are no longer supported and the host app drops them with a

   *  modern `attachments[]` field with `{ mimeType, data }` entries;
