# Product Hunt Listing — Draft v2

Reflects the final manifesto (post-revision) and the HN launch positioning. PH comes ~10 days after HN, so this listing inherits the same architectural framing the HN audience will have already seen.

## Tagline (≤60 chars)

**Primary:** open-source platform where Claude composes tools and GUIs — *57 chars*

Alternates:
- AI-native app platform where chat summons GUIs — *46 chars* (matches manifesto's section 2 title)
- How AI-native applications should be built — *43 chars* (essay title; works as tagline)
- Claude as a universal controller across plugins — *47 chars*

## Description (≤260 chars)

**Primary draft (245 chars):**

> An open-source AI-native application platform. Real apps already run on it: a full accounting system, the Encore obligation engine, a personal wiki, a Financial Advisor (Edgar SEC filings). Claude composes plugins in one turn. MIT · `npx mulmoclaude`.

**Alternate (251 chars), heavier on the architectural angle:**

> MulmoClaude is an open-source application platform where Claude acts as a universal controller across a plugin registry. Built on top of MCP, with gui-chat-protocol as the agent↔GUI extension. MIT · `npx mulmoclaude`.

## Topics (pick 3–4 from PH taxonomy)

- **Developer Tools** *(primary — the audience that responds to manifesto launches)*
- **Artificial Intelligence** *(required — places it in the active conversation)*
- **Open Source** *(required — MIT, npm-distributed, the protocol is part of the product)*
- **Productivity** *(optional fourth — the app does productivity work, but skip if it dilutes the dev-tools framing)*

## Maker's first comment (~380 words)

> Hey Product Hunt — Satoshi here.
>
> MulmoClaude is an open-source AI-native application platform. The unusual thing about it is structural: instead of being a single application, it's a registry of applications running as plugins, with Claude as a universal controller composing across them. Real applications running on it today include a full accounting system (with server-side bookkeeping logic), the Encore obligation engine, a personal wiki, a Financial Advisor (built on the Edgar SEC-filings plugin), and a Storyteller for interactive illustrated stories.
>
> Three architectural commitments:
>
> **1. The agent is a universal controller.** Claude is a controller in the MVC sense, joining the UI as a second way in — but with one decisive advantage: it can compose plugins in a single turn. "Summarize Q1 expenses as a chart" reads accounting, writes chart. No app-switching, no copy-paste between apps.
>
> **2. Chat summons GUIs.** The agent's reply isn't a string. It picks a format for the content: Markdown for prose, MCP tool invocations for rich GUI surfaces (chart, form, wiki, spreadsheet, 3D scene), MulmoScript for multimedia. In both directions — the agent can also request structured input via a form when free text isn't the right modality.
>
> **3. The protocol is open.** `gui-chat-protocol` is a small versioned npm package that **extends MCP for the visual layer** — defining the contract between agent and GUI. Built-in plugins, third-party npm plugins, and (in principle) any future host all implement against the same spec.
>
> One emergent consequence worth naming: premium SaaS features (multi-format export, BI dashboards, cross-app workflows) collapse into default cross-plugin composition. What used to be a paid upgrade tier becomes a single sentence.
>
> Full architectural argument: [How AI-Native Applications Should Be Built](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude/blob/main/MANIFEST.md)
>
> Install: `npx mulmoclaude` · MIT-licensed · github.com/receptron/mulmoclaude
>
> Curious what patterns you're seeing in your own AI-native builds — comment any reactions or counter-examples.

**Optional addition if HN went well** (insert before the manifesto link): *"This was on Hacker News last week — the conversation there helped sharpen the architecture. ([HN thread link])"*

## Gallery captions (placeholders — final captions follow actual shots)

| # | Manifesto section | Caption draft |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (hero) | Three commitments | "An open-source AI-native application platform. Claude composes across a registry of plugins as a universal controller." |
| 2 | Universal controller | "Two consumers of the same business-logic API: the traditional UI and the agent. The agent doesn't replace the UI — it joins it, with one advantage: it can compose plugins in a single turn." |
| 3 | Chat summons GUIs | "The agent picks the format for what arrives: chart, form, wiki, spreadsheet, 3D scene, or prose. And it can request structured input via forms when text isn't the right modality." |
| 4 | Accounting (Pattern A) | "Real server-side business logic. A photo of a paper receipt becomes a bookkeeping entry — no OCR pipeline, no premium SKU. Capability contributed by the agent, not the application." |
| 5 | Encore (Pattern B) | "Natural language in, domain-specific language out. The LLM is the interface to the engine, not the engine itself." |
| 6 | Premium features, for free (Pattern C) | "Multi-format export, BI dashboards, cross-app workflows — what SaaS sells as the upgrade tier collapses into default cross-plugin composition. One sentence replaces the paid plan." |

## Notes

- **Tagline #1 ("open-source platform where Claude composes tools and GUIs")** matches the HN submission title verbatim (minus the "Show HN: MulmoClaude –" prefix). Cohesion across launches: HN visitors who land on PH 10 days later see the same line they upvoted. The catchy "Chat summons GUIs" phrase from the manifesto still appears in the maker comment callout for readers who go deeper.
- **Description** leads with what it *is* (a platform) and what's *on it today* (named real apps). Avoids the "everyone says SaaS is dead" hook from the manifesto — that hook is essay register, not PH-listing register. The listing is a destination card; the essay is the argument.
- **Maker comment** mirrors the essay's three commitments structure (universal controller → chat summons GUIs → open protocol extending MCP) plus the Pattern C insight at the end. Slightly warmer than the HN version (Hey/Hi opener; less defensive about "where does this break"; more invitational ending).
- **HN reference is optional.** If HN goes well, the optional line in the maker comment becomes a social-proof asset for PH. If HN underperforms, omit silently — PH visitors don't know what HN reception looked like.
- **Gallery captions** now follow the final manifesto section names (Universal controller / Chat summons GUIs / Pattern A / Pattern B / Pattern C). Final captions get rewritten once the actual screenshots exist (task 6).
- **Topics**: "SaaS" as a topic on PH would be ironic-strong but probably reads as confused targeting. Skip.
